Introduction
============

AvaFrame is a cooperation between the Austrian Avalanche and Torrent Service
(Wildbach- und Lawinenverbauung; WLV) and the Austrian Research Centre for
Forests (Bundesforschungszentrum f√ºr Wald; BFW) within the Federal Ministry
Republic of Austria: Agriculture, Regions and Tourism (BMLRT).

Our mission is to develop an open source framework (licensed with the European
Union Public license (EUPL) ) for avalanche simulations which replicates and
simplifies current simulation procedures and models at the WLV and make them
accessible to the public domain.

Our aims are to make AvaFrame:

* applicable in an operational setting e.g. for hazard mapping or planning of
  mitigation measures within the WLV and civil engineering.
* extensible for scientific applications to be used to develop new methods,
  models and cover a wide range of scientific topics.
* easily usable and extendable by (inter-)national partners, academia and
  interested users.

AvaFrame is part of an BMLRT initiative to foster technological innovation within a strategic focus on the area of Austrian safety policies, digital innovations and climate mitigation strategies.

you have any questions or suggestions. AvaFrame is in an early development phase
and all ideas and contributions are welcome!
