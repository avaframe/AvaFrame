geoTrans
============
The :py:mod:`in3Utils.geoTrans` module provides useful functions to operate transformations,
comparison or interpolation on rasters, lines, points...
Further information about the available functions can be found in :py:mod:`in3Utils.geoTrans`



Generate Topography
===================

The :py:mod:`in3Utils.generateTopo` module provides functions to generate DEM files
for idealized/generic topographies that can be used for snow avalanche simulations.

This module can generate the following topographies:

* flat plane (FP)
* inclined plane of constant slope (IP)
* parabola - parabolic slope transitioning into a flat foreland (PF)
* hockey stick - inclined plane of constant slope with a smooth transition to a flat foreland (HS)
* bowl-shaped topography (BL)
* helix-shaped topography (HX)
* pyramid-shaped topography (PY)

Extra features can be added to the above topographies:

	* a channel can be introduced (then set ``channel=True``).
		This channel can also be set to widen towards the top and bottom of the channel (then set narrowing=True).
		The channel can be added by either adding a 'channel layer'
		(max thickness=channel depth) on top of the topography (``topoAdd=True``)
		or by cutting them into the original topography (``topoAdd=False``).
	* **in case of the parabola topography, a dam can be added by setting ``dam=True``.**

This modules returns a 3D plot of the generated topography as well as an .asc
file of the DEM data. The input parameters are defined in the respective
configuration file ``in3Utils.generateTopoCfg.ini``. Detailed information on the
individual functions used to create the topographies can be found in
:py:mod:`in3Utils.generateTopo`


To run
------

* first go to ``AvaFrame/avaframe``
* copy ``in3Utils/generateTopoCfg.ini`` to
  ``in3Utils/local_generateTopoCfg.ini`` and set the desired parameter values
  (if not, the default values are used)
* run::

	python3 runScripts/runGenerateTopo.py


Theory
------

Topographies are generated using inclined and flat planes, parabolas, spheres and circles.
Channels are introduced as half-sphere shaped features with smooth transition
from the no-channel area to the channel using cumulative distribution functions.

Configuration parameters
------------------------

In the case of the pyramid-shaped topography, the domain extent is defined by
the max elevation (z0 - elevation of the appex point) and the slope of the
pyramid facets (meanAlpha)

**Domain parameters:**

:dx: DEM spatial resolution [m]
:xEnd: total horizontal extent of the domain [m]
:yEnd: total vertical extent of the domain [m]


**Topography parameters:**

:flens: 	distance to the point where the slope transitions into a flat plane [m]
:meanAlpha: 	slope angle from the max. elevation to the start of the flat plane [°] - or slope of the inclined plane [°]
:C: 		total fall height [m]
:rBowl:	  bowl radius [m]
:rHelix:	  radius for helix [m]
:z0: 		max elevation [m]
:zElev:	  elevation of the flat plane [m]
:rCirc: 	radius of the smoothing circle [m]
:demType: topography types (FP, IP, PF, HS, BL, HX, PY - explanation given in the introductory description)
:flatx: extent of the flat foreland for the pyramid in x
:flaty: extent of the flat foreland for the pyramid in y
:phi: rotation angle for the pyramid


**Flags for channels and plotting:**

:channel: True - introduce channel; False - no channel
:narrowing: True - channel is wide at start and end and narrow in the middle part; False - channel is uniform
:topoAdd: True - add channel layer; False: cut channel into original topography;
:flagRot: True - rotate pyramid along z-axis


**Channel parameters:**

:cRadius:  standard channel radius
:cInit: start and end half width of channel that is narrower in the middle part
:cff: standard deviation sigma
:cMustart: mean mu - represents upper part of the channel
:cMuend: mean mu - represents lower part of the channel


Get Release Area
===================

:py:mod:`in3Utils.getReleaseArea` generates a release area for a topography
created with :py:mod:`in3Utils.generateTopo`, this function is available for the
following topographies:

* flat plane (FP)
* inclined plane (IP)
* parabola (PF)
* hockey stick (HS)

The release areas are defined as rectangular features build by four corner
points, which are based on the following conditions:

* prescribed vertical stretch in meters (difference in altitude)
* prescribed volume of the release area
* lower margin is located where the slope angle falls below 30°
* if slope does not fall below 30 °, the upper margin is located xStart away
  from the upper margin of the DEM

The release areas can be saved as shapefile, .nxyz and .txt file. The required
input parameters can be set in the respective configuration files
``in3Utils/getReleaseAreaCfg.ini`` and ``in3Utils.generateTopoCfg.ini``.
Detailed information on the individual functions used to create the release
areas can be found in :py:mod:`in3Utils.getReleaseArea`

To run
------

Following these steps, you can generate an avalanche test case including a DEM and a simple release area.

* first go to ``AvaFrame/avaframe``
* copy ``in3Utils/generateTopoCfg.ini`` and  ``in3Utils/getReleaseAreaCfg.ini`` to ``in3Utils/local_generateTopoCfg.ini``
  and ``in3Utils/local_getReleaseAreaCfg.ini`` and set desired parameter values (if not, the default values are used)
* run::

	python3 runGenProjTopoRelease.py

**Parameters:**

:hr: release area vertical stretch [m]
:vol: volume of snow in release area [m3]
:dh: release snow thickness [m]
:xStart: upper margin of the release area distance in x from origin [m]
:lenP: number of release area polygon points
:outputtxt: True - copy the output to txt file
:xExtent: horizontal extent of release area for flat plane
:alphaStop: slope angle that defines lower margin of release area
:relNo: number of release area for name
:relName: name of release area feature in shapefile


Initialize Project
=====================

:py:mod:`in3Utils.initializeProject` provides functions to initialize a project,
create the required directory structure and delete specified files or
directories.

The main function :py:func:`in3Utils.initializeProject.initializeFolderStruct`,
creates the folder structure required to perform avalanche simulations: ::

		NameOfAvalanche/
			Inputs/
				ENT/		- entrainment areas
				LINES/		- avalanche paths
				POINTS/		- split points
				REL/		- release area scenario
				RES/		- resistance areas
				SECREL/ - secondary release areas
				.asc		- DEM
			Outputs/
			Work/


The path to this folder is specified in the configuration file ``avaframeCfg.ini``, with the parameter *avalancheDir*.


To run
-------

* first go to ``AvaFrame/avaframe``
* copy ``avaframeCfg.ini`` to ``local_avaframeCfg.ini`` and set your desired avalanche directory name
* run::
	
			python3 runInitializeProject.py
