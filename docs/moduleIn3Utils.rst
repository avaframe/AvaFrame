geoTrans
===================
The ``geoTrans.py`` module gathers useful functions to operate transformations on raster, lines, points...

Functions
-----------

**Projection on Raster:**

``Points = projectOnRaster(dem, Points)`` takes a "dem" dictionary and "Points" dictionary
(wich can be a single point or a line...) in input and returns the "Points" dictionary with
an extra "z" argument representing the "z" coordinate of the (x,y) point on the dem.


``Points = projectOnRasterVect(dem, Points, interp = 'bilinear')`` Does the same as the previous
function but also operates on 2D arrays. All the calculation are vectorized to avoid loops.
Two interpolation methods are available, 'nearest' or 'bilinear'


**Prepare Line:**

``AvaProfile, projSplitPoint = prepareLine(dem, AvaPath, distance=10, Point=None)`` takes a "dem" dictionary,
a "AvaPath" dictionary (x, y coordinates), a re-sampling distance and a "Point" dictionary in input and returns
the "AvaProfile" dictionary corresponding to the "AvaPath" dictionary. That is to say the "line" dictionary re-sampled
according to distance with the corresponding "z" argument representing the "z" coordinate of the re-sampled (x,y)
point on the dem and the curvilinear coordinate "s" along the line (the first point of the line has a s=0).
It also returns the projection of the Point on the AvaProfile if this one was supplied in input.

**Project on Profile:**

``projSplitPoint = findSplitPoint(AvaProfile, splitPoint)`` takes a "AvaProfile" dictionary
and a "splitPoint" dictionary in input and returns the "projSplitPoint" dictionary which is the projection of
"splitPoint" on the "AvaProfile".


**Check Profile:**

``projSplitPoint, AvaProfile = checkProfile(AvaProfile, projSplitPoint=None)`` takes a "AvaProfile" dictionary
and a "projSplitPoint" dictionary in input and check if the Profile goes from top to bottom,
reverts it if necessary and returns the correct "projSplitPoint" and "AvaProfile" dictionaries.

**Prepare inputs for find angle in profile:**

``angle, tmp, deltaInd =prepareAngleProfile(beta, AvaProfile)`` takes a angle value in degres and
an Avalanche profile in input, computes the angle of the profile and returns this ``angle``, the list
of indexes ``tmp`` where the angle is under the input angle value and ``deltaInd`` the number of consecutive
indexes required.

**Find angle in profile:**

``idsAnglePoint =findAngleProfile(tmp, deltaInd)`` takes the outputs of ``prepareAngleProfile`` as inputs
and returns the index of the desired angle as output.

**Bresenham Algorithm:**

``z = bresenfindCellsCrossedByLineBresenhamham(x0, y0, x1, y1, cs)`` takes a two (x,y) points and a cell size in input and returns
the z = (x,y) list of the cells hit by the line between the two input points.


**Path to domain:**

``rasterTransfo = path2domain(xyPath, rasterTransfo)`` takes the (x,y) coordinates of a polyline,
a domain width and a cell size (in rasterTransfo) in input and returns the domain of width w along the polyline.

**Polygon to mask:**

``mask = poly2mask_simple(ydep, xdep, ncols, nrows)`` takes the (x,y) coordinates
of a polygon and a rater size in input and returns the raster mask corresponding to the polygon.

**In polygon:**

``IN = inpolygon(X, Y, xv, yv)`` takes the (X, Y) coordinates of points and xv, yv foot print of a
polygon on a raster in input and returns the raster mask corresponding to the polygon.



Generate Topography
===================

Generate DEM files for idealised/generic topographies that can be used as required DEM input data for snow avalanche simulations.

The following topography types can be chosen:

* flat plane (FP)
* inclined plane of constant slope (IP)
* hockey stick - using a parabola to describe the sloping plane that then transitions into a flat foreland (HS)
* hockey stick smooth - using an linearly sloping plane with smoothed transition to the flat foreland (HS2)
* bowl-shaped topography (BL)
* helix-shaped topography (HX)
* pyramid-shaped topography

On top of these topographies, channels can be introduced (then set flag_channel=True), and these channels can also be set to become narrower along the channel and wider at the end of the channel (then set flag_narrowing=True).
There is the option to introduce these channels by either cutting them into the original topography (flag_topoconst=True) or by adding a 'channel layer' (max thickness=channel depth) on top of the topography.

Input
------

* in ``generateTopoCfg.ini`` all required input parameters are listed (does include default values for all parameters)

Output
-------

* 3D surface plot of generated topography as .png file and possibly shown to screen (see flags)
* .asc file of DEM data


To run
------

* copy ``generateTopoCfg.ini`` to ``local_generateTopoCfg.ini`` and set desired parameter values (if not, the default values are used)
* in ``Avaframe/`` run::

	python3 runGenerateTopo.py


Theory
------

Topographies are generated using inclined and flat planes, parabolas, spheres and circles.
Channels are introduced as half-sphere shaped features with smooth transition from no channel to channel using cumulative distribution functions.

Configuration parameters

:c_ff: standard deviation sigma
:c_mustart: mean mu - represents upper part of the channel
:c_muend: mean mu - represents lower part of the channel


Get Release Area
===================

Generate a release area for a topography created with ``generateTopo`` , this function is available for the following topographies:

* flat plane (FP)
* inclined plane (IP)
* hockey stick (HS)
* hockey stick smooth (HS2)

The release areas are defined as rectangular features build by four corner points, which are based on the following conditions:

* prescribed vertical stretch of 200 m (difference in altitude)
* prescribed volume of the release area
* lower margin is located where the slope angle falls below 30°
* if slope does not fall below 30 °, upper margin is located xStart away from upper margin of the DEM

Input
------

* in ``getReleaseAreaCfg.ini`` and ``generateTopoCfg.ini`` all required input parameters are listed (does include default values for all parameters)

Output

``makeADir(dirName)`` takes a path to directory and if this directory does not yet exist, creates
the directory *dirName*.


**readLogFile:**

``logDict = readLogFile(logname, cfg='')`` takes a log file and returns a dictionary with information
on the simulations that have been performed.


**extractParameterInfo:**

``parameterDict =  extractParameterInfo(avaDir, simName)`` reads the log saved when performing a simulation
with com1DFA and returns a dictionary with info on the release mass, the final time step and the current mass.
