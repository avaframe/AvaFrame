QGis AvaFrameConnector
======================

The AvaFrameConnector allows QGis users to access certain base workflows directly from QGis. The connector 
only provides the interface to functions within the AvaFrame python package, and is developed separately, see the
`QGisAF github repository <https://github.com/avaframe/QGisAF>`_. 
It makes use of the QGis processing plugin, which is included in all current QGis releases. 

.. Note::
   ALL (!!) data provided to the functions below HAVE to be in the same projection. It does not matter which
   projection it is as long as it it the same one.

Operational

   :sorted:
  
   Dense Flow (com1)
      Runs dense flow avalanche module com1DFA. For more specific info about the inputs (shapefile attributes etc), see 
      :ref:`moduleCom1DFA:Input`. You can select multiple shapefiles for release areas, each will be calculated as one scenario. 
      Each shapefile can contain multiple polygons. If you provide entrainment/resistance areas, each scenario will be calculated 
      once without them (i.e null simulation) and once with them. It is possible to override the default friction
      parameter set *samosATAuto* to another samosAT friction model calibration.
   
   Alpha Beta (com2) 
      Runs the alpha beta calculation via module com2AB. For more specific info about the inputs (shapefile attributes etc), see 
      :ref:`moduleCom2AB:Input`. 

   Operational Run (com1 and com2)
      Runs com1DFA and additionally com2AB if profile and splitpoint are set. 
      Additional info see description of *Dense Flow Standard (com1)* and *Alpha Beta (com2)*.


Experimental
------------

These either require deeper knowledge about the AvaFrame python package, i.e. configuration files etc., or are not yet 
fully tested and might produce unwanted results.

   Generate mass average path (ana5, com1)
      Generates the mass average path from a dense flow simulation via module ana5Utils.

   Layer rename
      Renames com1DFA result layers by adding the values of the given variable (from the configuration file).

   Probability analysis for directory (ana4)
      Runs the probability analysis on com1DFA results from a given avalanche directory without running any
      simulations. Please provide the base avalanche directory (i.e. the one containing INPUT, OUTPUT, *.log etc).

   Probability run (ana4, com1)
      Runs probability simulations via module com1DFA. The release shape HAS TO HAVE a ci95 field containing the
      95 percentile confidence interval (same unit as the release thickness). Multiple scenarios can be provided,
      final map includes variations from all scenarios combined. Release thickness and SamosAT friction mu
      are being varied, 40 variations per scenario.

   Release area stats (in1, com1)
      Returns info for release area statistics in a csv file. See output of QGis processing for the location of
      the file. 

   Rock Avalanche (com6)
      Runs rock avalanche simulations via module com1DFA. For more info see com6RockAvalanche section in the
      documentation. Note that a release thickness raster the same size as the DEM is needed.

   Snow slide (com5)
      Runs snow slide simulations via module com1DFA. For more info see com5SnowSlide section in the documentation.
      The resistance layer is meant for building outlines.
