   beta point
   10 deg point
      The point along a topography profile at which the slope angle is 10
      degrees. Is usually considered to be the point after which the profile is
      consistently below 10 degrees.

   beta angle
      Angle from the topmost point of a profile to the :term:`beta point`.

   release thickness [*relTh*]
      TODO: which symbol

      snow thickness normal to surface in a release area.

   entrainment thickness [*entTh*]
      snow thickness normarl to surface in entrainment area

   avalanche path
   avalanche profile
      The main path of an avalanche (catchment), i.e. NOT in regard to a
      specific :term:`scenario`. This is usually seen as the path that describes
      the main characteristics of the avalanche best. It is recommended to start
      this path at (or close to) the highest point, then follow the main features
      downslope and extend it far enough in the runout zone to accommodate even
      the biggest :term:`scenario`. Once set for a specific avalanche, it
      should only be changed for very important reasons, as this path ensures
      the consistency and comparabilty between different investigations or experiments.

   runout
      The furthest point downslope an avalanche reaches. This can be defined
      either by the furthest particle, or could also be defined with
      pressure values, i.e. the furthest point where an avalanche is above 1
      kPa, or similar.

   runout distance
      The distance of the :term:`runout` from the first point of the (user
      provided) main :term:`avalanche path`. The distance is measured along the
      path. It does **not** provide an information about the actual distance
      snow/material travelled for a certain :term:`scenario`, see :term:`runout
      length` for this. Runout distance can be seen a characteristic of a
      certain avalanche catchment.

   runout length
      The actual length the snow/material of a certain :term:`scenario` travels, i.e. the distance
      from release area to the runout along the :term:`avalanche path`.

   runout area
      The area a :term:`scenario` covers with its runout inside the
      :term:`runout zone`. ???

   runout zone
      The area/zone in which runouts usually end up. ???

   scenario
      One or more ...
