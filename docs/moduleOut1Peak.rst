out1Peak: Peak plots
##################################



Plot all peak fields
====================

:py:func:`out1Peak.outPlotAllPeak.plotAllPeakFields` generates one plot for each peak field in *Outputs/modName/peakFiles*.
These peak fields represent the peak values of the simulation result parameters (*dynamic peak pressure*, *peak flow depth*, *peak velocity*),
and modName corresponds to the name of the computational module that has been used to perform the simualtions.
Details on this function, as for example required inputs, can be found in :py:func:`out1Peak.outPlotAllPeak.plotAllPeakFields`.

To run
------

* first go to ``Ã€vaFrame/avaframe``
* in your run script call::

   plotAllPeakFields(avalancheDir, cfg, cfgFlags, modName)


Plot all fields
====================

:py:func:`out1Peak.outPlotAllPeak.plotAllFields` generates one plot for each simulation result field provided in the specified input directory.
This function is designed to work for result fields that follow a certain naming convention in order to provide full functionality:
*releaseAreaName_simulationType_modelType_simulationIdentifier_resultType.asc*

One plot for each field is saved using the name of the input field. Details on this function, as for example required inputs,
can be found in :py:func:`out1Peak.outPlotAllPeak.plotAllField`.

To run
------

* first go to ``AvaFrame/avaframe``
* in your run scripts: call::

   plotAllFields(avalancheDir, inputDir, outDir, resType=resType)
