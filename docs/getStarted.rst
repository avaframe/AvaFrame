Getting started
================

Even-though most of the routines in Avaframe are automatized, running them still
requires a minimum amount of python scripting. The following example should make
it easier for you to find your way in Avaframe.
Before starting, make sure you have installed Avaframe and the required
dependencies as explained in :ref:`develop:How to install`.

Initialize project
-------------------
The next step is to create the folder where the input data lies and where the
output results will be saved. :ref:`moduleIn3Utils:Initialize Project` section
should guide you through this step.
