Installation 
============

.. Note::
  There are two ways to install and use AvaFrame:

  Standard 
    If you want the operational workflow, running *com1DFA* (dense flow avalanche) and *com2AB* (alpha beta)
    with standard settings from within *QGis*, head over to the :ref:`operational:Standard / Operational Installation` section.
    Use this if you want to:

    - use the standard, well tested and calibrated setup for hazard mapping or similar
    - use QGis as frontend
    - have results in a short amount of time 
    - use the latest release 


  Development
    If you want to contribute and develop AvaFrame, head over to :ref:`developinstall:Development Installation`.
    Use this if you want to:

    - work on the code itself
    - implement new features
    - change/improve existing code
    - have the latest development code. *Warning: might be unstable!*

..  Experiment **-Does not work at the moment; still under development-**
    If you want to build your own workflows and experiment with all modules,
    head over to the :ref:`installation:Experiment setup and run` section.
    Use this if you:

    - are familiar with programming in python and the terminal
    - want to build your own workflow
    - just want to adjust parameters in the configurations
    - want to use the latest release
