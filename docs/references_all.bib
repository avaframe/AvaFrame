	abstract = {The first recordings of acoustic signals associated with avalanches
	go back to the 1970s when premonitory low-frequency acoustic emission
	was observed in the snow cover just before the setting off of natural
	avalanches (Sommerfeld, 1977; Sommerfeld and Gubler, 1983). Recently,
	it has been demonstrated that avalanches also produce strong infrasonic
	vibrations in air during their movement. These infrasonic vibrations
	propagate great distances and can follow the natural relief. It was
	then a question of automatically detecting this emission to monitor
	avalanche activity, with a view to improving forecasting and assisting
	in the study of certain aspects of avalanche dynamics. With the double
	aim of pursuing investigations on the mechanics of the acoustic emission
	from avalanches and designing an automatic detection system, our
	laboratory has developed specific instrumentation, the essential
	link of which is an array of infrasonic microphones associated With
	a goniometer. Systematic measurements of the infrasonic emissions
	are being carried out, not only of the natural or released avalanches
	themselves but of all events with the aim of characterizing the former
	in relation to "infrasonic noise".},

	Norway during the 2002 melt season. The profiles represent different
	elevations, aspects and terrain types. At snow maximum the spatial
	distribution of snow above the tree line was positively skewed (long
	tall in the positive direction), whereas the spatial distribution
	below the tree line followed a more normal distribution. During the
	snowmelt season the spatial distribution of snow became increasingly
	skewed. By separating the datasets into two terrain classes, alpine
	and forest, the snow distribution could be described by a time-variant
	gamma distribution function, one for each terrain class. The results

@article{An2012,
	abstract = {Predicting the occurrence and spatial extent of extreme avalanches
	is a longstanding issue. Using field data pooled from various sites
	within the same mountain range, authors showed that the avalanche
	size distribution can be described using either an extreme value
	distribution or a thick-tailed distribution, which implies that although
	they are much larger than common avalanches, extreme avalanches belong
	to the same population of events as “smallâ avalanches. Yet,
	when looking at historical records of catastrophic avalanches, archives
	reveal that a few avalanches had features that made them “extraordinary.â
	Applying avalanche-dynamics or statistical models to simulate these
	past events runs into considerable difficulty since the model parameters
	or the statical properties are very different from the values usually
	set to model extreme avalanches. Were these events genuine outliers
	(also called “dragon-kingsâ)? What were their distinctive
	features? This paper reviews some of the concepts in use to model
	extreme events, gives examples of processes that were at play in
	extreme avalanches, and shows that the concept of dragon-king avalanches
	is of particular relevance to describing some extreme avalanches.},

@article{An2005,
	abstract = {The idea that snow avalanches might behave as granular flows, and
	thus be described as Coulomb fluid flows, came up very early in the
	scientific study of avalanches, but it is not until recently that
	field evidence has been provided that demonstrates the reliability
	of this idea. This paper aims to specify the bulk frictional behaviour
	of snow avalanches by seeking a universal friction law. Since the
	bulk friction coefficient cannot be measured directly in the field,
	the friction coefficient must be calibrated by adjusting the model
	outputs to closely match the recorded data. Field data are readily
	available but are of poor quality and accuracy. We used Bayesian
	inference techniques to specify the model uncertainty relative to
	data uncertainty and to robustly and efficiently solve the inverse
	problem. A sample of 173 events taken from seven paths in the French
	Alps was used. The first analysis showed that the friction coefficient
	behaved as a random variable with a smooth and bell-shaped empirical
	distribution function. Evidence was provided that the friction coefficient
	varied with the avalanche volume, but any attempt to adjust a one-to-one
	relationship relating friction to volume produced residual errors
	that could be as large as three times the maximum uncertainty of
	field data. A tentative universal friction law is proposed: the friction
	coefficient is a random variable, the distribution of which can be
	approximated by a normal distribution with a volume-dependent mean.},

	abstract = {Knowing the path profile and the avalanche velocity variations with
	downstream distance makes it possible to deduce the bulk frictional
	force experienced by an avalanche during its course. This derivation
	was applied to 15 documented events reported in the literature. Three
	types of rheological behavior were identified: ( 1) the inertial
	regime, where the frictional force drops to zero; (2) the Coulombic
	frictional force, where the force is fairly independent of the avalanche
	velocity; and ( 3) the velocity-dependent regime, where the force
	exhibits a complicated (nonlinear and hysteretic) dependence on velocity.
	During its course an avalanche can experience one or several regimes.
	Interestingly, the Coulomb model can provide predictions of the velocity
	and run-out distance in good agreement with field data for most events,
	even though for some path sections the bulk frictional force departs
	from the Coulomb model. This result is of primary importance in zoning
	applications since it makes it possible to deduce avalanche velocities
	from a knowledge of the run-out distance. Its physical meaning is,
	however, not clearly demonstrated in this paper due to the lack of
	suitable data.},

	abstract = {Avalanche dynamics models are increasingly used to estimate the features
	of extremely rare events for avalanche zoning. They employ a frictional
	coefficient, which reflects something close to snow viscosity. As
	this coefficient is more conceptual than physical, it cannot be measured
	and must be fitted by matching avalanche dynamics model results and
	field data. However, most of the time, the historical record is not
	long enough to fit this coefficient for extremely rare events. Here
	we propose a deterministic inversion method to obtain the probability
	density function of this coefficient. The method has been applied
	to two avalanche paths in the French Alps, each with a sustained
	avalanche activity over the last century. For applications the Voellmy
	avalanche dynamics model has been used with no loss of generality.
	It is shown that the friction coefficient is a random variable whose
	marginal probability distribution varies rapidly and exhibits two
	or more peaks.},

	abstract = {Avalanche hazard is a threat to many residential areas in Iceland.
	In 1995 two avalanche accidents, causing a total of 34 fatalities
	in areas thought to be safe, prompted research on avalanche hazard
	assessment. A new method was developed, and in 2000 a new regulation
	on avalanche hazard zoning was issued. The method and regulation
	are based on individual risk, or annual probability of death due
	to avalanches. The major components of the method are the estimation
	of avalanche frequency, run-out distribution and vulnerability. The
	frequency is estimated locally for each path under consideration,
	but the run-out distribution is based on data from many locations,
	employing the concept of transferring avalanches between slopes.
	Finally the vulnerability is estimated using data from the 1995 avalanches.
	Under the new regulation, new hazard maps have been prepared for
	six of the most vulnerable villages in Iceland. Hazard zones are
	delineated using risk levels of 0.2 x 10, 0.7 X 10(-4) and 2 X 10(-4)
	a(-1), with risk less than 0.2 x 10(-4) a(-1) considered acceptable.
	When explaining the new zoning to the public, a measure of annual
	individual risk that allows comparison with other risks in society
	has proven advantageous.},

	A new methodology to estimate the hazard component of avalanche risk
	based on the use of dynamic models is introduced. This approach seems
	to have some advantages over the current methods based on statistical
	analysis of historic avalanche data. The vulnerability component
	of risk is formulated as a function of avalanche velocity, according

	effect on the resulting risk mapping of using different vulnerability

	event. The model sensitivity to friction coefficients, release depth,
	release area and runout distance is also analysed. The hydraulic-continuum
	models yield similar reference coefficients on the simplest topography,

	boundary conditions on model performance. The Coulomb friction (mu)
	shows a closer relation to runout distance than the turbulent friction
	(xi). For models of this type, the debris deposition pattern is useful
	for selecting model coefficients, rather than relying purely on runout
	distances. The results of the sensitivity analysis are site-specific,
	again highlighting the importance of terrain as a model boundary
	condition. The release area seems ro have less of an influence on
	model results than the fracture height and xi. In general, the models

	the uncertainties inherent in the current procedures for avalanche
	hazard assessment. A Monte Carlo approach to hazard mapping is proposed
	for this purpose. This statistical sampling analysis method allows
	us to evaluate the probability distributions of the relevant variables
	for avalanche hazard assessment-essentially runout distance and impact
	pressure-once the release variables and the model parameters are
	expressed in terms of suitable probability distributions. In this
	way it is possible to explicitly account for uncertainties both in
	the input-data definition of the dynamic models and in the mapping
	results. The overall methodology is presented in detail and applied
	to a real-world avalanche mapping problem. The one-dimensional version
	of the VARA models is used for avalanche dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the surface mass balance of a horizontally homogeneous
	snowfield, with emphasis on the effects of snowdrift sublimation.
	A one-dimensional model of the atmospheric boundary layer that includes
	snowdrift physics and thermodynamics is used. In sufficiently strong
	winds, snow particles are eroded from the surface. Once airborne,
	they are susceptible to sublimation. Averaged over longer time periods,
	the net erosive flux equals sublimation of snowdrift. However, model
	results show that there is no such balance in the course of a snowstorm
	event. They also indicate that snowdrift sublimation tends to enhance
	net erosion, but the increase occurs more slowly than the mass transfer
	by snowdrift sublimation, and the maximum is smaller. This difference
	in temporal behaviour influences the average erosion rate owing to
	non-linear interactions between snowdrift sublimation, drift density
	and erosion. Since the increase in relative humidity due to snowdrift
	diminishes surface sublimation, the average change in total ablation
	induced by snowdrift sublimation remains small. Observations made
	during snowdrift episodes in Antarctica agree qualitatively with
	some of the model results.},

	abstract = {Snowdrift is one of the many manifestations of two-phase flows in
	which the inherently stably stratified drift-density profile acts
	to destroy turbulence. This can be quantified by using an appropriate
	"particle" Richardson number, equivalent to thermally stratified
	flow. This Richardson number is proportional to the mean fall velocity
	of the particles (averaged over the particle-size spectrum) and the
	drift density, and therefore depends strongly on height above the
	surface. It exhibits a maximum close to the surface, where drift
	densities are largest. It then decreases to minimum values at intermediate
	heights, above which Richardson numbers increase with height. The
	particle Richardson number and the associated decrease in turbulent

	snow on turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer. Turbulence is
	diminished in drifting and blowing snow, since part of the turbulent
	energy is used to keep the particles in suspension. This decrease
	in turbulence directly affects the vertical turbulent fluxes of momentum
	and snow particles (and other scalars), and can effectively be simulated
	by introducing an appropriate Richardson number to account for the
	stability effects of the stably stratified air-snow mixture. We use
	a one-dimensional model of the atmospheric surface layer in which
	the Reynolds stress and turbulent suspended snow flux are parameterized
	in terms of their mean vertical gradients (first-order closure).
	The model calculates steady-state vertical profiles of mean wind
	speed, suspended snow mass in 16 size classes and stability parameters.
	Using the model, the influence of snowdrifting on the wind-speed
	profile is quantified for various values of the initial friction
	velocity (which determines the steepness of the initial wind-speed
	profile). It will be demonstrated why the roughness length appears
	to increase when snowdrifting occurs. Finally, we present a parameterization
	of the effects of snowdrifting on atmospheric stability which can
	be used in data analyses as a first-order approximation.},

	We collected data from two adjacent parts of a slope 6 days apart.
	In addition, one manual snowpack profile was sampled each day, as

	an index of shear strength. For the SMP data, a 900 m 2 area was
	sampled on both days in a grid with points 3 m apart, with some sub-areas
	of more closely spaced measurements. We collected 86 SMP profiles
	on the first day and 129 on the second day. Our analyses involved
	manually locating layer boundaries and calculating statistics for
	the force signal through the surface-hoar layer. The shear strength
	index increased by 40\% between the two sampling days, but the SMP
	data show no statistical difference in layer thickness, and the mean,
	minimum, median, and a variety of percentile measures of the SMP
	force signal through the layer also do not change. Interestingly,
	the maximum hardness, and the variance and coefficient of variation
	of the SMP signal, increased. Since the small SMP tip might only
	break one or a couple of bonds as it passes through the weak layer,
	we interpret these changes as being indicative of increasing bond
	strength. Though we cannot specifically tie the increasing maximum

	that the maximum SMP signal within buried surface-hoar layers may
	be useful for tracking increases in the shear strength of those layers.},

	run-out can be achieved with various combinations of model parameters.
	At the fixed value of the coefficient of entrainment me , we have
	a curve on a plane of the coefficients of dry and turbulent friction.
	It was found that the family of curves (me is a parameter) are crossed
	at the single point. The value of the coefficient of turbulent friction
	at the cross-point remained practically constant for the maximum

	by the results of modelling for six arbitrarily chosen avalanche

	profile. The dependences of run-out on the coefficient of dry friction
	are constructed for all the investigated avalanche sites. The results
	are important for the statistical simulation of avalanche dynamics

	abstract = {Even though the danger-level verification indicated in a bulletin
	should be a priority aim of avalanche-forecast services, there are
	no easily applicable verification methods available today. The main
	difficulty lies in the fact that avalanche observation is no longer
	sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to verify the actual condition
	of the snowpack stability, particularly concerning low danger levels.
	This work introduces a procedure for "a posteriori" field verification
	of danger level, both in space and time (24-72 hours). The method
	is based on the following elements: avalanche-activity survey, observation
	of cross-country skiers' activity, snow profiles and "Rutschblock"
	tests. These elements, relating both to time and the examination
	zone, are combined to provide an objective danger degree according
	to the European avalanche-danger scale. The method was used experimentally
	in the winter of 1993-94 in the Dolomites and subsequently, in the
	winter of 1995-96 in the Catalan Pyrenees. As far as 24 hour forecasts
	are concerned, the method has shown a forecast reliability of 93\%
	in the Dolomites and 76\% in the Catalan Pyrenees, while 48 hour
	forecasts have given values of 89\% and 64\%, respectively. The lower
	degree of forecast reliability in the Catalan Pyrenees is accounted
	for by the unusual weather conditions of winter 1995-96 which was
	very snowy and characterized by few foreseeable avalanche conditions.
	The practical application of the proposed verification method has
	given encouraging results, thus allowing experts to find the main
	errors in order to improve future forecasts. However, simpler survey
	procedures are necessary in order to operate on a regional scale.
	The method is suitable for further development relating to verification
	of both degree of danger and danger localization.},

	of natural snow collected from the nearby study plot were loaded
	in simple shear with monotonically increasing stress (stress ramp)
	and with sinusoidally varying stress (oscillation). The dynamic measuring
	method allows the deformation process to be separated into a time-independent

	is sufficiently small to prevent destructive deformation, generally
	permitting the true viscoelastic properties of a sample to be obtained
	over a large range of frequency and temperature. The limit strain
	for linear viscoelastic deformation was found to be very small (0.5-5

	textural changes (damage, breaking of bonds). The large strain reached
	during stress-ramp experiments showed that the ongoing damage process
	must be balanced by a healing (sintering) process. The usefulness

	abstract = {Avalanche risk is considered as the probability of an avalanche event
	that could cause certain losses. A unified approach for avalanche-risk
	evaluation by statistical simulation is suggested. A chain of models,
	describing snow deposition, transformation, stability, avalanche
	dynamics and interaction with an obstacle, is used within such an
	approach. Each of the models evaluates a given situation in a deterministic
	manner, yielding a unique result value. Output data of each model
	can be the input for the next model in the chain. Uncertainty of
	input data is described in a probabilistic manner. Using the chain
	of the deterministic models and simulating the input data according
	to appropriate probability distributions with the Monte Carlo method,
	risk evaluations are obtained as the ratio of a number of certain
	types of outcome to the total number of tests. All kinds of information
	on weather, snow and avalanches can be used within this scheme. The
	simulation process can be started at any stage of the modelling.
	In this study it was started from the snow-cover stability simulation.
	Application of the statistical simulation in such a way gives an
	opportunity to reflect uncertainty of the initial data in the results
	obtained. The suggested scheme was used for producing a computer-assisted
	workplace for avalanche forecasting, "LAVINA', which has been exploited
	at the Centre of Avalanche Safety of 'Apatit", Kirovsk, Russia, since
	the early 1990s. It is an integrated system that permits spatial
	and temporal estimations of snow stability and avalanche dynamics
	to be made. Assessments of the validity of the risk estimation made
	with LAVINA are presented.},

@article{Ch2001,
	abstract = {Detailed data on autumn, winter and spring snow-cover conditions front
	remote areas are often difficult or very expensive to obtain. Therefore,
	an inexpensive method of digital photography was tested in high-Arctic
	Greenland. Automatic digital photography has provided daily data
	on snow distribution and snow depth for > 1 year from the Zackenberg
	area (74 degrees 30'N) in northeast Greenland. A standard digital
	hand-held camera (Kodak Digital Science DC50) was equipped to become
	automatic; it is supplied with an "automatic finger" and an external
	power supply and built into a protecting box with additional solar
	panels on top, in order to secure Continuous operation throughout
	the year. The daily photograph covers a 100 in transect through a
	seasonal snowpatch, and thus on an annual basis also yields information
	on snow-cover duration in the different vegetation zones of the snowpatch.
	The camera was installed in mid-August 1998. Photographs from the
	period mid-August 1998 to early September 1999 were collected and
	analyzed. All photos are taken at astronomic noon in order to use
	the daylight as long as possible into the winter season before the
	24 h winter darkness begins in mid-November. The digital photographs
	yielded the following information for the year 1998/99. The first
	winter snowfall occurred on 18 October; small-scale snow redistribution
	by snow-drifting started when the winter snow cover was about 5 cm
	thick. The continuous winter snow cover lasted for a minimum of 170
	days in the most snow-deprived areas downwind of the snowpatch, whereas
	snow in the centre of the snowpatch stayed on the ground for > 325
	days, turning the snowpatch perennial in summer 1999. Meteorological
	data obtained close to the photographed snowpatch site, in combination
	with the snow-cover depth and distribution data derived I from the
	photographs, show that at wind speeds (at 2 in height) of up to around
	6 m s(-1) only small-scale snow-drifting took place, when the snow
	cover was thin. Intense snowdrifting, however, took place at wind
	speeds of 8-13 in s(-1), particularly when enough snow was available
	in the upwind area. The automatic Continuous photography technique
	demonstrated here could be particularly useful in remote areas at
	high risk of avalanches during winter. It is an alternative to traditional
	snow monitoring achieved mainly by sonic sensors, snow pillows or
	manual measurements of snow depths. Likewise, it can provide better
	areal information than most standard methods, which give only point
	measurements.},

	abstract = {Measurements and observations by others indicate that a potential
	slab avalanche consists of a relatively cohesive slab of snow overlying
	a thin weak layer that contains flaws where locally the shear stress
	from the overburden is not fully supported. Under favorable conditions,
	snow will shear strain-soften, which provides the basis for applying
	a slip-weakening model to examine the size of flaw needed to initiate
	sub-critical crack propagation along the weak layer. Using typical
	values for snow properties: the model predicts sub-critical crack
	growth can initiate from a relatively small flaw well before the
	shear stress from the overburden approaches the peak shear strength
	at the bed. The occurrence of small flaws or imperfections in the
	basal layer would explain field measurements which usually indicate
	that avalanching occurs before the applied shear stress exceeds the
	shear strength at the basal layer. Widespread slab-avalanche activity
	often increases significantly soon after the onset of rain on new
	snow. Measurements of temperature and mechanical properties show
	that only the upper 0.15 m or less of the slab has been altered at
	the time of avalanching; alterations at the sliding layer have not
	yet been detected. Results from the slip-weakening model indicate
	that the rain-induced alterations would reduce the size of flaw needed
	to initiate sub-critical crack growth by 10-20\%. The observations
	and model results show clearly the importance of the slab properties;
	it is evident that both the slab and the weak layer act together
	to control slope stability. A further implication is that the stability
	of freshly deposited snow is often close to critical, because a relatively
	small surface perturbation is often sufficient to cause avalanching.
	This is not surprising, because it is well known from field observations
	that new snow on slopes should be treated with caution.},

	abstract = {A small avalanche path near the Bridger Bowl ski area in southwestern
	Montana has been instrumented to measure density, velocity and dynamic
	friction in a flowing avalanche. These measurements, made by an array
	of sensors mounted in the avalanche path, have been carried out for
	several dry-snow avalanches. Measurements of density were made using
	a capacitance probe that measures the dielectric constant of any
	material that passes in Gent of it. Through a calibration procedure,
	the dielectric constant of a given type of snow can be related to
	the density of that snow Optical sensors were used to measure light
	reflected from the avalanche as it passed by the sensors. Signals
	from adjacent optical sensors were cross-correlated to determine
	velocity Density and velocity measurements were made at several heights
	in the avalanche, with particular attention directed near the running
	surface. Results indicate that avalanche deformation is concentrated
	near the running surface where the snow density is found to be largest.
	Upward from the surface, the velocity gradient falls off greatly
	while the density also declines. Finally, the dynamic-friction coefficient
	at the base of the avalanche was found by measuring shear and normal
	forces on a roughened 23 cm x 28 cm aluminum plate mounted parallel
	and flush with the avalanche running surface. The ratio of the shear
	force to normal force on the plate provides a measure of the dynamic-friction
	coefficient at the base of the avalanche.},

	abstract = {Wind transport of snow can cause an additional snow load on leeward
	slopes, which often has a considerable influence on avalanche danger.
	For a quantitative assessment of this process, a model is proposed
	which calculates the snow transport over a two-dimensional mountain
	ridge, based on input measurements of wind speed and precipitation.
	Since the topography is idealized, the model is focused on the snow
	mass that is transported over the ridge, and no statements are made
	about the exact snow distribution over the slopes. Three transport
	modes are distinguished: snow transport in saltation, snow transport
	in suspension, and preferential deposition of precipitation. Suspension
	is modelled with a one-dimensional diffusion equation, and for the
	saltation layer a newly developed model, based on the microscale
	physical processes, is implemented. The effect of speed-up of the
	wind over the ridge is included by assuming an analytical wind profile
	with a maximum wind speed at a few meters above the ridge. Advective
	effects are taken into account in a parameterization of the. turbulent
	shear stress profile. The model is compared with measurements taken
	at the experimental snowdrift site Gaudergrat in the Parsenn area,
	Switzerland, and good agreement is obtained between calculated and

	abstract = {Avalanche-hazard estimation for the present and the following days
	is one of the main tasks of the avalanche forecaster. For 4 years,
	some have used the results of a series of automatic numerical models
	in the Alpine massifs of France. Thee programs describe in real time
	the main meteorological conditions (SAFRAN), the evolution of the
	snow cover (Crocus) and the resulting avalanche risks (MEPRA) at
	different elevations, slopes and aspects of the massifs considered.
	This paper presents the latest evolution of this automatic tool.
	With the new version it is now possible to provide 1 day forecasts
	of the state of the snow cover over the massifs of both the Alps
	and Pyrenees, including the main characteristics of the snowpack
	and an assessment of the corresponding avalanche hazards. To achieve
	this result, the main changes were with SAFRAN. Two combined methods
	are used within the same package: adaptations of larger-scale meteorological
	forecasts and use of observations of analogous weather situations
	from the past. These two approaches are complementary especially
	for evaluating precipitation where the second solution has important
	fine-scale information while the first exhibits important local biases.
	Validation of this new application was done carefully and proved
	the quality of the method, now used in real-time by local forecasters.
	We present some validation results, concerned both with forecasted
	precipitation fields at the scale of the massif and forecasted avalanche
	risks deduced from MEPRA.},

	an assessment of the, appropriate shear velocity, an evaluation of
	the occurrence of transport related to the snow characteristics provided
	by the software PROTEON and an estimation of the transport rates.
	These different computations are embedded in the new software, SYTRON,
	which is inserted in the SAFRAN/Crocus/MEPRA operational chain. Different

	abstract = {Dense snow avalanches are regarded as dry granular flows. This paper
	presents experimental and numerical modelling of deposition processes
	occurring when a gravity-driven granular flow meets a fence. A specific
	experimental device was set up, and a numerical model based on shallow-water
	theory and including a deposition model was used. Both tools were
	used to quantify how the retained volume upstream of the fence is
	influenced by the channel inclination and the obstacle height. We
	identified two regimes depending on the slope angle. In the slope-angle
	range where a steady flow is possible, the retained volume has two
	contributions: deposition along the channel due to the roughness
	of the bed and deposition due to the fence. The retained volume results
	only from the fence effects for higher slopes. The effects of slope
	on the retained volume also showed these two regimes. For low slopes,
	the retained volume decreases strongly with increasing slope. For
	higher slopes, the retained volume decreases weakly with increasing
	slope. Comparison between the experiments and computed data showed
	good agreement concerning the effect of fence height on the retained
	volume.},

	of the Automated Indicator based

	Model Evaluation and Comparison (AIMEC). Computational snow avalanche
	simulation has gained

	importance in hazard mapping and mitigation planning. The simulations
	are based on depth averaged

	models operating in three-dimensional terrain, providing results such
	as flow velocity, depth and

	pressure. Complexity and large amount of results make an objective
	comparison of a high number of

	simulation runs challenging and difficult to interpret. Here we present
	applications of AIMEC, which

	has been introduced to: (1) effectively handle large amounts of simulation
	results, (2) provide

	mathematical definitions representing main avalanche features in a
	clear and comprehensive way, (3)

	provide the basis to evaluate deterministic simulation results by
	means of probabilistic methods. Key

	point of this method is a coordinate transformation in an avalanche
	path dependent system, which

	allows to introduce new metrics, the so called indicators. The indicators
	allow to directly analyze large

	samples of simulation runs with respect to e.g., the avalanche run
	out or destructiveness. Two

	examples show how to (1) improve model calibration by evaluating simulation
	results with field data

	and (2) compare the results of different simulation software, highlighting
	the influence of the different

	of avalanche simulations with

	a broad applicability in model evaluation, comparison as well as model

@conference{FiGr2012,
	abstract = {{The snow avalanche simulation toolbox SamosAT is used as a supporting
	tool for hazard mapping questions in

	Austria and some other European countries. SamosAT comprises two different
	model classes. A two-dimensional,

	depth averaged model for the description of dense flow avalanches
	and a three-dimensional, two-phase (air and

	ice particles) model for powder snow avalanches. The toolbox allows
	to compute and display the space and time

	evolution of the main avalanche flow variables such as flow height,
	-velocity or concentration from initiation to run

	out.

	On the one hand displaying the multidimensional data in natural terrain
	provides the basis for an intuitive result

	interpretation by the user. Clearly this is helpful for case studies
	and decision making. On the other hand the

	complexity and huge amount of result data makes an objective comparison
	of a high number of different simulation

	results challenging. This however is the basis of sophisticated model
	analysis and evaluation, such as sensitivity

	analysis, calibration, comparison to other models etc.

	Here we present new methods to analyze and objectively compare a high
	number of simulation results with respect

	to their practical relevance. Thus the variation of simulation results
	due to sources of variability and uncertainty

	can be displayed in a clearly arranged and objective way. The following
	steps are considered:

	• Automatization for SamosAT to enable a high number of simulation
	runs only outputting the relevant results.

	• Definition of avalanche quantities with practical relevance. Here
	the spatial distribution of the maximum im-

	pact pressure serves as a basis to define geometric (run out and shape)
	and dynamic (mean impact pressure)

	quantities.

	• Development of a technique to map the simulation results computed
	in a global coordinate system on a co-

	ordinate system aligned with the avalanche flow path. Thereby we achieve
	comparability and generalization

	for arbitrary avalanche paths.

	Finally case studies of the European avalanche test sites are presented
	employing the new methods. Release height

	variations as well as model parameter Monte Carlo simulations are
	investigated with respect to their influence on

	the result distribution. The methods presented here aim at supplementing
	expert result interpretation and providing

	the basis of an additional enhanced analysis for multidimensional

	abstract = {{SamosAT is a simulation toolbox for avalanches. It includes a model
	for dense flow avalanches which describes

	an avalanche as a shallow flow and can be used with various rheologies.
	Additionally a two phase air/ice particle

	mixture model is used to describe the motion of powder snow avalanches.
	The fundamental laws of mass and

	momentum conservation are the basis of the dynamic models.

	The initial mass distribution is one of the main input variables when
	considering avalanche simulations. Release

	areas and release heights are defined with certain rules found in
	literature. Snow entrainment and erosion along the

	avalanche path are important processes influencing the avalanche dynamics.
	When taking entrainment processes

	into account, the model equations of mass and momentum balance gain
	extra terms and parameters. Additionally

	entrainment areas and heights have to be defined. To this date the
	implementation of these processes in applied

	avalanche models is still work in progress. The two model types of
	SamosAT incorporate different entrainment

	possibilities. For the dense flow model, frontal entrainment (ploughing)
	or a shear stress dependent erosion can be

	considered. The mass of the powder snow avalanche is determined by
	a shear stress dependent flux function. Here

	the mass can be entrained from the underlying dense flow avalanche
	or directly from the snow cover.

	In this work the implementation of the different entrainment mechanisms
	in SamosAT is described. Furthermore

	a new ’mountain snow cover approach’ is suggested in order to provide
	a standardized method to determine the

	initial mass distribution when considering significant amounts of
	entrainable snow. This approach is based on the

	well known methods used to determine release heights in applied avalanche
	modeling. Finally well documented

	avalanche events are compared to the simulation results considering
	the different snow entrainment mechanisms.}},

	abstract = {Snow, from its fall until its full melting, undergoes a structural
	metamorphism that is governed by temperature and humidity fields.
	Among the many possible mechanisms that contribute to snow metamorphism,
	those that depend only on curvature are the most accessible to modelling.
	In this paper, techniques of volume data analysis adapted to the
	complex geometry of snow are introduced and then applied to experimental
	tomographic data coming from the isothermal metamorphism of snow
	near 0 degrees C. In particular, an adaptive algorithm of curvature
	computation is described. Present results on the evolution of specific
	surface area and anisotropy already show that such image-analysis
	methods are relevant tools for the characterization of real snow
	microstructures. Moreover, the evolution of the curvature distribution
	with time provides valuable information for the development of sintering
	models, in the same way as a possible quantitative calibration of
	snow-grain coarsening laws.},

	abstract = {Weak layers such as buried surface hear or depth hear frequently form
	the failure plane of slab avalanches. Therefore, the mechanical properties
	of such layers in relation to their snow structure have been investigated.
	Since it is difficult to transport samples containing a weak layer
	into cold rooms, the mechanical measurements have to be made in situ.
	We investigate strain-rate dependency of shear strength by measuring
	concurrently strength, deformation and acceleration, using a digital
	force gauge attached to a 0.05 m(2) shear frame to which an accelerometer
	and a displacement sensor are fixed. In doing so, a dynamic force
	comparable to a driving skier is applied. The measurements cover
	a strain-rate range 10(-2) to 1(s)(-1). The samples fail in a brittle
	manner. The shear-strength values cover the range 0.2-2.8 kPa. The
	dataset is also used to approximate the coefficient G, the shear
	modulus, for different weak layers. The snow structure has been analysed
	macroscopically in the field and for some layers representative snow
	samples have been extracted in order to prepare, in the cold laboratory,
	single-sided serial planes with cuts every 0.1mm recorded by video.
	The analysis of these snow samples should have given the relation
	between some mechanical properties (strength, strain) and the structural
	properties. Due to basic problems in defining the connection between
	complex snow grains (e.g. surface hear), we were unable to complete
	this part in due time. Only preliminary results on this aspect are
	presented here. Based on our long-term database, containing macroscopic
	structural and strength data of weak layers, a relationship between
	snow type and shear strength has been established.},

	The alpine site, characterized by a plateau topography, is located

	mass flux at this site are presented: one snow-collector column and
	two types of snow traps. Snow-collector columns (prismatic boxes)

	(NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor for
	snow-cover analysis of the European Alps. For mapping snow cover
	in heterogeneous terrain, we implement the widely used linear spectral

	component analysis, including the reflective part of AVHRR channel
	3, is used to estimate fractions of "snow" and "not snow" within
	a pixel, using linear mixture modeling. The combination of these
	features leads to a fast, simple solution for operational and near-real-time

	The detailed snow-cover information makes it easy to recognize the

	binary map or a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
	snow product. The sub-pixel algorithm reasonably identifies snow-cover

	according to their mechanisms, the flow regimes in which they occur,

	models are proposed for erosion by impacts, abrasion, plowing and
	blasting. On the basis of order-of-magnitude estimates, the first

	mechanism stipulates that the compaction of the snow cover ahead
	of the avalanche leads to the flow of escaping air just in front
	of the avalanche that may disrupt the snow cover and support formation
	of a saltation layer. The effects of this hypothetical mechanism
	resemble those of the plowing mechanism. All mechanisms depend strongly
	on the snow properties, but, with plausible parameter values, erosion
	rates at or above the experimentally found rates are obtained. The
	entrainment rate of all avalanche is most often limited by the shear
	stress needed to accelerate the eroded snow to avalanche speed.},

	abstract = {Hazard and risk assessment in avalanche-prone areas involves estimation
	of runout distances of potential avalanches. Methods for determination
	of the runout may be divided into two categories: 1) methods based
	on statistical approaches such as the well known \ABM model or 2)
	methods based on numerical avalanche models such as the PCM-model
	or VS-type models (just to name the more traditional ones). Methods
	in the second group have the advantage that besides the runout distance,
	velocity and impact pressure distributions along the avalanche track
	can also be obtained, this being a requisite for meaningful risk
	assessments. However, the predictive power of dynamical models depends
	on the use of appropriate rheological models and their parameters.
	In the statistical \ABM model, the maximum runout distance is solely
	a function of topography. The runout distance equations were found
	by regression analysis, correlating the longest registered runout
	distance of several hundred avalanche paths with a selection of topographic
	parameters. In this paper, we re-evaluate Norwegian and Austrian
	avalanche data, which served as basis for the \ABM model in the respective
	countries, and additional avalanche data with respect to dynamical
	measures. As most of those avalanche data originate more or less
	from extreme events (i.e.\ avalanches with return periods of the
	order of 100 years), the dynamical measures may give hints about
	an appropriate rheology for dynamical models suitable for extreme
	avalanche events. The analysis raises reasonable doubt whether the
	classical ansatz for the retarding acceleration of snow avalanches
	with additive terms involving Coulomb-friction and a velocity-squared
	dependency, which is used in many avalanche models, is adequate for
	a physically-based model. Back-calculations of runout distances using
	a simple block model show a discrepancy between commonly proposed
	parameter values (and of the underlying rheological models) and the
	observations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we show that a detailed snow model (here, the Crocus
	model) may help to validate large-scale inferred meteorological datasets
	(e.g. from climate models or analyses) over the data-sparse ice sheets.
	Two series of snow simulations are carried out with two different
	meteorological datasets in input to the snow model. Both datasets
	are extracted from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
	meteorological analyses and forecast archives. First, the microwave
	signatures of the surface of central Greenland from the Scanning
	Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) are compared with the simulated
	density, grain-size and stratigraphy, The annual mean gradient ratio
	and polarization ratio, which are related to the emissivity of snow,
	are found to correlate spatially with these snow structural parameters.
	The sensitivity of the snow structure to differences in the two meteorological
	sets is then examined. It is found to be high for temperature and
	infrared radiation, precipitation and surface wind. The quantitative
	value of this result is limited by a still limited snow model validation
	over Greenland. Also, an optimal use of satellite data and a snow
	model for meteorological validation would require physically based
	translation of the simulated snow parameters into radiative properties,
	i.e. radiation transfer modeling.},

	abstract = {At 1455 h on 18 January 1997, an airborne powder avalanche with a
	volume of about 3 x 10(6) m(3) flowed along the tongue of Brenva
	glacier, high Aosta valley, on the southern flank of Val Veny, Italy.
	It descended 2000 m and covered a distance of 5.5 km, with a rate
	of movement on the intermediate stretch of > 70 ms(-1). It killed
	two skiers following a valley-bottom piste, damaged a hotel, destroyed
	a wide belt of woodland on the opposite slope and caused other minor
	damage. The avalanche occurred immediately after a large rockfall
	on the southern slope of the Sperone della Brenva (3567 m a.s.l.).
	However, the relationship between the two events call only be considered
	indirect, since the main mass of the rockfall stopped at the base
	of the scar, on a large plateau oil the glacier surface. The rockfall
	and subsequent shock caused the contemporaneous detachment of masses
	of ice and/or firn from hanging glaciers at the head of a nearby
	cirque, leading to the formation of the avalanche. The complex mechanism
	of detachment hypothesized was induced from available documentation
	and from in situ investigations. Its phases also coincide with seismograms
	recorded at a station 45 km from the avalanche area. Finally, a mathematical
	model of the avalanche was used to reconstruct its dynamics and path.},

	altitudinal belts of avalanching are distinguished: (I) permanent

	cover, duration of the avalanche-prone period and number of days
	with avalanche-prone snowfalls. At the beginning of the twenty-first
	century, there will likely be a smoothing of the sharp differences
	in avalanche activity between various mountain regions of the World.
	Avalanche activity should be less in the most active regions and

	abstract = {Snow avalanches threaten settlements and roads in steep mountainous
	areas. Hazard mitigation strategies apply numerical models in combination
	with GIS-based methods to determine run out distances and pressure
	maps of snow avalanches in three-dimensional terrain. The snow avalanche
	modelling system is usually applied to study single avalanche tracks.
	In this paper we investigate the application of a numerical modelling
	system for large area hazard analysis. We begin by briefly presenting
	the depth-averaged equations governing avalanche flow. Then, we describe
	the statistical and GIS-based methods that are applied to define
	the initial fracture depths and release areas for snow avalanche
	modelling. We discuss the calibration of the avalanche model friction
	coefficients for extreme avalanches in function of altitude, avalanche
	size and topography. Seven test sites with areas between 100 and
	350 km(2), that are well distributed over the different snow climates
	and elevation ranges of Switzerland, were used to calibrate the model
	by comparing the simulation results with historic avalanche events
	and existing avalanche hazard maps. We then show how the avalanche
	modelling system was applied over the mountainous region of Switzerland
	(25,000 km(2)) to delineate forests with protective function against
	avalanches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	situation was a valuable test of the avalanche-hazard mapping procedure
	developed in Switzerland since the last extreme avalanche winter

	was underestimation of the hazard of powder-snow avalanches. The
	other reason the hazard-zone boundaries were passed was multiple
	avalanche events in a single track within a short time period. In
	addition, some fracture depths were larger than those used in avalanche-dynamics
	calculations. Therefore, the guideline assumptions for defining the
	fracture depths are questioned. Winter 1999 impressively underlined
	the danger of avalanches in mountainous regions. It emphasized the

	a 50 channel spectroradiometer, was flown on board the NASA ER-2

	of mapping snow in different surface covers using an algorithm designed
	to map global snow cover after the launch of MODIS in 1998. The surface
	cover in this area of central Alaska is typically spruce, birch,
	aspen, mixed forest and muskeg. Integrated reflectance, R-i, was
	calculated from the visible/near-infrared channels of the MAS sensor
	The R-i was used to estimate different vegetation-cover densities
	because there is an inverse relationship between vegetation-cover
	density and albedo in snow-covered terrain. A vegetation-cover density
	map was constructed using MAS data acquired on 13 April 1995 over
	central Alaska. In the part of the scene that was mapped as having
	a vegetation-cover density of < 50\%, the snow-mapping algorithm
	mapped 96.41\% snow cover. These areas are generally composed of
	muskeg and mixed forests and include frozen lakes. In the part of

	abstract = {A system for predicting avalanche hazard in the windy climate of Vestfirdir,
	northwest Iceland, is presented. The system is based on (a) numerical
	simulations of the snowpack and evaluation of avalanche hazard due
	to overloading by the snow models SAFRAN-Crocus and MEPRA, and (b)
	observations of wind speed in the mountains used as a proxy for snowdrift.
	The system was tested during two winter seasons and correctly predicts
	30 out of 35 avalanche days. The 5 missing days feature either large
	spatial gradients in precipitation or very strong winds a few days
	before the avalanches, indicating much snowdrift. A comparison of
	the simulated avalanche hazard and observations of avalanches confirms
	that snowdrift is of primary importance not only for large avalanches,
	as already established, but also for small and medium-size avalanches
	in Vestfirdir. The system is a first step towards an objective evaluation
	of avalanche hazard in Iceland.},

	de la Neige, the snow research department of Meteo-France. SAFRAN
	analyzes weather parameters relevant to snow on the ground, and Crocus
	simulates the build-up or the snowpack. In this study, simulated

	station located 640 m.a.s.l. in central Iceland. The results from

	of the models systematically underestimated the snow depth and density
	of the snowpack. Corrections for the effect of wind on snow density
	and on precipitation measurements led to significant improvements
	in simulated snow depths. The simulations are sensitive to the threshold
	temperature between snow and rain. The remaining problems in simulating
	the snowpack are mainly related to transport of snow by wind, which
	is not accounted for in the models, and to some extent to melting
	and sublimation in strong winds.},

	abstract = {The reduced societal acceptance of living in regions exposed to snow
	avalanches, and the increased economic consequences when houses are
	located within a hazard zone, highlight the uncertainty concerning
	avalanche run-out prediction. The limitations of today's zoning procedures
	are especially pronounced in potential avalanche terrain where there
	are few observations of snow avalanches, where old buildings are
	present in the potential run-out zone, and where the local climate
	does not favour severe snow accumulation. This paper combines a mechanical
	probabilistic model for avalanche release with a statistical/topographical
	model for avalanche run-out distance to obtain the unconditional
	probability of extreme run-out distance. For the mechanical model,
	a first-order reliability method (FORM) and Monte Carlo simulations
	are compared. The interpretation of the statistical/topographical
	model either as an extreme value model or as a single value model
	is discussed. Furthermore, both a classical approach where the probability
	of an avalanche occurring is a constant, and a Bayesian approach
	with stochastic probability, are compared. Finally, example applications
	in hazard zoning are presented, with emphasis on how the influence
	of historical observations, local climate, etc., on run-out distance
	can be quantified in statistical terms and how a specified certainty
	level can be found from constructing confidence intervals for, for
	example, the most likely largest run-out distance during various
	time intervals.},

	abstract = {The chemical composition of snow and meltwater in the 13 km(2) catchment
	of Scott Turnerbreen, Svalbard, was investigated during the spring
	and summer of 1993. This paper assesses the provenance of solute
	in the snowpack and its impact on runoff chemistry. Dry snow contains
	420 mu eql(-1) of solute, is slightly acidic (pH 5.4) and is dominated
	by Na+ and Cl-. Wet snow is more dilute (total concentration 340
	mu eq1(-1)), and less acidic (pH 5.9). This is consistent with the
	elution of ions from the snowpack by meltwater. Snowpack solute can
	be partitioned into the following fractions: sea-salt aerosol, acid
	aerosol and crustal. About 98\% of snowpack solute is sea salt, yielding
	22 000 kg km(-2) a(-1). The behaviour of snowpack-derived Cl- in
	runoff is distinctive, peaking at over 800 mu eq 1(-1) early in the
	melt season as runoff picks up, before declining quasiexponentially.
	This represents the discharge of snowmelt concentrated by elution
	within the snowpack, which subsequently becomes relatively dilute.
	A solute yield of 140 kg km (-2) a (-1) can be attributed to anthropogenically
	generated acid aerosols, representing long-range atmospheric transport
	of pollutants, a potential contributor to Arctic runoff acidification.},

	abstract = {Snow surface temperature (T-s) plays an important role in the formation
	of surface hoar or near-surface faceted crystals. The goal of this
	study was to obtain detailed information on T-s in different forest
	stands near the timberline. The investigations were conducted during
	clear nights and showed that the snow surface temperature is influenced
	very strongly by the forest canopy. While the air temperature was
	very similar on the different experimental sites, T-s was higher
	in the forest than in the open field; on the south-facing slope the
	difference between the forest and the open field was 3-4.5 degreesC,
	and on the north-facing slope approximately 3-7 degreesC. Taking
	into account that epsilon (air) is 0.7 and epsilon (trce) is 0.94,
	the incoming radiation (I down arrow) for the different experimental
	sites was calculated by the equation of Brunt (the canopy density
	was estimated using photographs taken with an 8 mm fish-eye). To
	calculate T-s, air temperature and averaged values of the net radiation
	(because the net radiation (I) has only a small range of variation
	during clear nights) were used. The results show that the calculated
	values were higher than the measured values (by approximately 2 degreesC).
	However, a better correlation was found by using lower values of
	the emissivity (epsilon (air)0.67 and E(trce)0.91).},

	abstract = {This paper deals with air temperature, net-radiation and relative-humidity
	measurements which we performed in Austria in different zones of
	mountain forests in recent years. Our aim using such measurements
	was to approximate the general conditions for the formation of surface-hear
	layers in low-density forest stands near the timber line. These layers
	are a necessary condition for snow-slab release and avalanche formation.
	Our investigations showed that the total radiation balance was negative
	but less negative in a forest with a close canopy (on clear nights
	about -30 to -40 W m(-2)) than within a small clearing (6 m by 6
	m). Moreover, the total radiation balance within the forest clearing
	was almost the same as that in an open field. There we measured -60
	to -80 W m(-2) on clear nights. Approximations of surface temperature
	(t(s)) showed that t(s) was below the dewpoint (t(E)) in an open
	field but did not reach t(E) in the forest; moreover, t(s) was very
	close to t(E) within the forest clearing. Water-vapor flux was positive
	only in open terrain (i.e. condensation between 0.1 x 10(-6) and
	0.9 x 10(-6) kg m(-2) s(-1)) and evaporation occurred within the
	clearing and in the forest.},

	abstract = {In heavy-snowfall areas facing the Sea of Japan, winter seasons with
	lower volumes of snow occurred from 1986/87 to 1999/2000. In this
	paper, the changes induced by these warmer winters in snowy areas
	in Japan are investigated using two datasets. One set was normalized
	for the period 1971-2000 from manned surface meteorological observations
	by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and the other set was for 1961-90.
	Winter climatic monthly values for the first dataset were thought
	to be affected by the warmer winter seasons since almost half the
	relevant period coincides with them. By comparing each monthly climatic
	value in both datasets, the following results were obtained: (1)
	At each meteorological observation site the bimonthly average temperature
	from January to February increased and the amounts of increase were
	about 0.4 degrees C on average. (2) The bimonthly maximum snow depth
	for the same period increased at a number of sites, but usually by
	only a few centimeters, the maximum increase being 0.05 m. (3) In
	contrast, the decreases in snow depth in heavy-snowfall areas facing
	the Japan Sea, which belong to a temperate climate zone, were large,
	ranging from about 0.05 to 0.22 m in climatic bimonthly maximum snow
	depth during January and February. The last result shows that snow
	covers in such warm snowy areas are very sensitive to climatic changes.
	An attempt is also made in this paper to estimate the amounts of
	decrease in snow depth from the increases in air temperature and
	the decreases in precipitation amounts.},

@article{Is1998,
	abstract = {New categories for the climatic division of snowy areas according
	to their snow-cover character in mid-winter are proposed. They are
	a wet-snow region, a dry-snow region, an intermediate snow region
	and a depth-hear region. The wet-snow region is defined as the region
	in which every layer of deposited snow is wet due to percolation
	of snowmelt water throughout the winter. In contrast, areas in which
	the snow cover is dry, at least in the coldest period of the winter
	season, are classified into two categories, that is the dry-snow
	region and the depth-hear region. In the latter region, the small
	snow depth and low air temperature induce development of depth hear.
	The intermediate snow region was introduced to indicate an intermediate
	character between the dry-snow and wet-snow regions. From the climatic
	dataset calculated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency and from
	snow surveys, it has been found that in snowy areas; which have a
	climatic monthly mean temperature in January (T-jan) higher than
	0.3 degrees C, snow would be expected to be wet throughout the winter
	and, in areas that have T-jan lower than -1.1 degrees C, to be dry
	at least in the coldest period. Snow covers, where T-jan is between
	these two values, are expected to have intermediate characters. Therefore,
	these temperatures are supposed to be critical values among the wet,
	dry and intermediate snow regions. The criterion that separates the
	depth-hoar region from the dry-snow areas was found to be given by
	a climatic mean temperature gradient. This value lies between 10
	degrees and 12 degrees Cm which is derived by dividing the absolute
	value of the average of the climatic monthly mean air temperature,
	which is always below 0 degrees C, by the average of the monthly
	maximum snow depth during January and February.},

	abstract = {Following Norem's description of powder-snow avalanche formation and
	structure, we propose a mathematical model that consists of a suspension
	layer and a so called saltation layer. The latter is only a few meters
	deep and is modelled by depth-averaged mass and momentum balances.
	In the suspension layer, the mass- and momentum-balance equations
	for the mixture are supplemented by the snow mass balance and the
	transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation.
	Mass and momentum exchange between the two layers is determined by
	particle settling, turbulent diffusion against the concentration
	gradient and aerodynamic shear forces. The net erosion or deposition
	rate is a function of the kinetic energy of the impacting particles.
	The saltation layer reacts on the suspension layer in that saltating
	particles extract momentum from the air flow. The preliminary estimates
	of the model parameters can be refined by means of saltation-trajectory
	simulations. Three-dimensional simulations with a simplified model
	have clearly shown the importance of snow erosion and deposition
	in practical applications. This approach is well suited for coupling
	to a dense-flow avalanche model.},

	abstract = {Avalanche defence structures such as retarding dams and breaking mounds
	are widely used to protect residential areas and other kinds of infrastructure.
	The effect of the defence structures depends largely on their effective
	height relative to the velocity, volume and flow depth of the avalanche.
	Snow depositions from earlier avalanches as well as from drifting
	snow can significantly alter the effective height of defence structures.
	Different designs of avalanche-breaking mounds and retarding dams
	were tested in the Cemagref (Grenoble, France) wind tunnel for their
	effect on drifting snow. Examples included dams and mounds of different
	sizes and heights. The models were tested in a wind tunnel with sand
	particles subjected to different wind directions. The resulting depositions
	were scanned with a laser system to obtain a three-dimensional picture
	of the accumulation pattern. The results show that the accumulated
	snow varies widely with the design of the structure for a given wind
	direction. Most snow is accumulated around narrow mounds, with least
	accumulation observed around mounds covering a smaller relative area
	of the avalanche path. The data obtained can be used to study the
	effect of the depositions on the retarding effect of the avalanche
	defence structures. However, because the similarity criteria for
	studying the interaction between structures and saltating particles
	in a wind tunnel cannot be met, the transfer of the results to reality
	must be performed with caution.},

	abstract = {The shear frame allows testing of thin weak snowpack layers that are
	often critical for slab avalanche release. A shear metal frame with
	an area of 0.01-0.05 m(2) is used to grip the snow a few mm above
	a buried weak snowpack layer. Using a force gauge, the frame is pulled
	until a fracture occurs in the weak layer within I s. The strength
	is calculated from the maximum force divided by the area of the frame.
	Finite-element studies show that the shear stress in the weak layer
	is concentrated below the cross-members that subdivide the frame
	and where the weak layer is notched at the front and back of the
	frame. Placing the bottom of the frame in the weak layer increases
	the stress concentrations, and results in significantly lower strength
	measurements than placing the bottom of the frame a few mm above
	the weak layer. Based on over 800 sets of 7-12 tests in western Canada,
	coefficients of variation average 14\% and 18\% from level study
	plots and avalanche start zones, respectively. Consequently, sets
	of 12 tests typically yield a precision of the mean of 10\% with
	95\% confidence. which is sufficient for monitoring of strength change
	of weak layers over time in study plots. With consistent technique,
	there is no significant difference in mean strength measurements
	obtained by different experienced shear frame operators using the
	same approximate loading rate and technique for placing the frame.
	Although fracture surfaces are usually planar, only one of eleven
	shapes of non-planar fracture surfaces showed significantly different
	strength compared to planar fracture surfaces. For weak layers thick
	enough for density measurements, the shear strength is plotted against
	density and grain form. From these data, empirical equations are
	determined to estimate the shear strength of weak snowpack layers.},

	evolution of microstructure and its effect on continuum-scale deformation
	for the constant-speed uniaxial-strain compaction of an aggregate
	of roughly spherical elastic-plastic particles. Simulation results
	are used to explain some micromechanical aspects of snow compaction.
	Different compaction rates were used to examine the limits of quasi-static
	response and the effects of inertial stresses. Four stages of microstructurally
	controlled compaction were observed for quasi-static loading: particle
	re-arrangement, elastic deformation and two stages of plastic deformation.
	Elastic deformation follows the first critical density caused by
	the stable random loose-particle packing of rough spheres. Stage
	III compaction occurs by plastic deformation once stresses acting
	on particles exceed yield. Stage IV compaction follows a second critical
	density caused by the stable packing of deformed particles and is
	also through plastic deformation of particles. During high-sped compaction,
	inertial stresses propagate particle deformation from the loading
	platen into the aggregate. as a consequence, particle re-arrangement
	is limited so that the pressure density ratio is larger for high-speed
	compaction than for quasi-static compaction at the same density.
	Hence, critical densities and the compaction-rate dependence of the
	pressure-density ratio during compaction of an aggregate of particles
	composed of rate-independent material are;determined by the evolution
	of microstructure at different compaction rates. Observed pressure-density
	profiles for polar snow exhibit the same features of critical density
	and changes in the pressure-density ratio as found in the simulation
	and consist of four compaction stages: particle re-arrangement and

	abstract = {To develop avalanche runout models for short slopes, field measurements
	were made at 48 short-slope avalanche paths located in the Coast,
	Columbia and Rocky Mountains of western Canada, and at several paths
	in eastern Canada. Field studies included detailed topographic surveys
	and estimation of the extreme runout position in each path. A statistical
	runout model was developed using the runout ratio method, for which
	runout ratios from the four mountain ranges are well fit by an extreme-value
	type I (Gumbel) distribution when the beta point is defined at the
	uppermost point where the slope is 24 degrees. A second model was
	developed by regressing the a angle for the extreme runout position
	on numerous terrain variables. This regression model uses three predictor
	variables that can be easily measured in the field or on topographic
	maps. Length-scale effects were noted in both models, but are more
	pronounced in the runout ratio model. A comparison of models developed
	using the two methods shows that the runout ratio model estimates
	more conservative (longer) runout distances than the regression model
	for most threshold probabilities. Data from 13 additional paths from
	Switzerland and Quebec, Canada, are used to test the models.},

	abstract = {Most algorithms to extract dry snowpack water equivalent (SWE) from
	satellite passive-microwave observations are based on point measurements
	of SWE or extrapolation of point measurements to the 30 km footprint
	of the satellite observations. SWE observations on a scale comparable
	to the satellite observations can be obtained from airborne gamma-ray
	attenuation techniques from flight lines that are approximately 10
	km long. During the winter of 1989, the NOAA National Operational
	Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) flew 92 of these flight
	lines over a 200 x 250 km area of the Red River basin which is located
	in the north-central part of the United States of America. These
	observations provide a unique dataset of snow water-equivalent determinations
	on spatial scales similar to the satellite passive-microwave observations
	as acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
	Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) F-8 satellite. Land-classification
	determinations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
	(AVHRR) show that the eastern part of the region contains a coniferous
	forest of varying coverage, while the remainder is farmland or prairie.
	SSM/I data, including observations from a no-snow case in the preceding
	fall, the flight-line data and the AVHRR data were all co-registered
	to a common 20 km grid. The resulting dataset tvas analyzed using
	linear regression, artificial intelligence and general linear models.
	The results showed that the passive-micro-wave response was similar
	to the response predicted by Mie scattering theory. A comparison
	of the three techniques found that the artificial intelligence technique
	and the general linear model explained significantly more of the
	variance in the dataset, as evidenced by R-2 values of 0.97 compared
	to 0.88 for the linear multiple-regression analysis. Hence, a neural
	network approach which was continually trained on new datasets as
	they became available, could provide better estimates of snowpack
	water equivalent than algorithms based on linear-regression techniques.},

	in a sub-alpine ski resort in central Switzerland (1100 in a.s.l.)
	where artificial snow was produced. Physical snow properties and
	soil temperature measurements were carried out on the ski slope and
	off-piste during winter 1999/2000. The numerical soil-vegetation-atmosphere
	transfer model COUP was run for both locations, with a new option
	to simulate the snowpack development on a groomed ski slope. Snow
	density. snow hardness and thermal conductivity were significantly
	higher on the ski slope than in the natural snowpack. However, these
	differences did rift affect the cooling of the soil, since no difference
	was observed between the ski slope and the natural snow cover. This
	might be because cold periods were rare and short and thus any snowpack
	could protect the soil from freezing. The major impact of the ski-slope
	grooming was a 4 week delay in snowmelt and soil warming at the end
	of the season. The newly implemented option proved to be a useful
	strategy for simulating the snowpack of a ski slope. However, snow
	density was underestimated by the model as it could not account adequately
	for compaction due to grooming traffic. Our study demonstrates that
	there is no site-independent answer as to whether a groomed snowpack

	to be measured during an avalanche, the run-out distance was found
	to be determined quite accurately. A number of the Voellmy coefficients

	abstract = {Heavy rain on snow often leads to disastrous damages in torrent watersheds.
	In January 1998 a project was started to investigate "runoff and
	infiltration characteristics of different alpine soil/vegetation
	units under snow cover". One aim was to determine the runoff rates
	from snow-covered, differently cultivated soil/vegetation units (pastures,
	dwarf-shrub stands, forests), especially under conditions of sparse
	snow cover and frozen soil. Differences in runoff formation between
	artificially snowed skiing areas and plots with natural snow cover
	were also of interest. Heavy rain (intensity 100 mm h(-1)) was simulated
	on four plots by using a transportable spray irrigation installation.
	The investigations showed runoff coefficients of 0.4-0.7. The lowest
	runoff values were found where the soil under snow cover was not
	frozen, but even on these stands the runoff coefficient exceeded
	0.4. Snow depth and runoff delay are strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.8).
	An increment in snow of 10 cm is followed by a runoff delay of 3.6
	min. Divergences from this coherence are due to the composition of
	the snowpack, especially in case of artificial snow. This result
	is encouraged by runoff simulations performed for the irrigated plots
	by use of a hydrological model.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a method for estimating the depth of new snow,
	using hourly data of total snow depth and precipitation. As the snow
	cover is compacted continuously due to its own weight, the depth
	of new snow deposited since the previous time-seep to the present
	time is given by a difference between the height of the present snow
	surface and the present compacted height of the previous snow surface.
	Thus, based on viscous compression theory and an empirical relation
	between compressive viscosity and the density of snow, an equation
	has been derived to compute the time variation of the thickness of
	a snow layer due to viscous compression. Using this equation, the
	present height of the previous snow surface, which cannot be measured
	by simple means, was computed and the depth of daily new snow was
	estimated as its difference from the present measured total snow
	depth. The approximated results were found to be in good agreement
	with data measured in Tohkamachi during the three winters from 1992-93
	to 1991-95. The standard deviation was 1.71 cm and the maximum difference
	between estimated values and observed values was +/- 8 cm.},

	in all snow micropenetrometer profiles. The penetration resistance
	of adjacent layers did not change abruptly but gradually across layer
	boundaries that were typically 2 mm thick. In two layers, penetration
	resistance varied around 200\% over the grid, possibly due to wind
	effects during or after layer deposition. Penetration resistance
	varied around 25\% in five layers. Statistically significant slope-scale
	linear trends were found for all layers. The semivariogram was used
	to describe the spatial variation. Penetration resistance was autocorrelated,
	but the scale of variation was layer-specific. A buried layer of
	surface hoar was the most critical weak layer. It had little spatial
	variation. The layers in the slab above had higher spatial variation.
	The penetration resistance of each snow layer had distinct geostatistical

	to the berm. We found that large quantities of excess snow could
	be removed by use of vortex fences which cause erosion on the leeward
	side of the fence. The vortex fence was designed to be portable (unlike
	traditional jet or blower fences) and self-orienting into the wind
	to allow snow removal regardless of the wind direction. The vortices
	generated by the fence do not dissipate rapidly, providing effective

	abstract = {SNOWPACK has been in operational use for five consecutive winters
	on approximately 100 automatic weather stations in the Swiss Alps.
	It calculates snow precipitation, snowdrift and the layered structure
	of the snow cover. An analysis routine has been implemented that
	gives a stability estimation for a model profile. We distinguish
	between slab instability and direct action or deformation-rate instability.
	Slab instability relies on a static force balance within the snowpack
	(stability index) and may be used to assess stability for both natural
	and skier-triggered slab avalanches. We heuristically improve the
	slab index by adding a term of overload correction for all grain
	types and scaling the stability index with the bond size. Deformation-rate
	instability means that the load of the snow cover increases faster
	than the snow gains strength. An index is formulated based on the
	snow deformation rate. It may be associated with large snowfall events
	and wet-snow situations as they occur in catastrophic situations,
	or with the effect of a sudden increase in temperature. The results
	of both stability indices are compared to the forecasted avalanche
	danger. The indices are able to recognize cases of avalanching. It
	is shown that the inclusion of several locations, for which the indices
	are calculated, improves the correlation between stability indices
	and avalanche danger. A sufficient number of profiles could bridge
	the gap between snow-cover characteristics at a point and avalanche
	danger.},

	is crucial for validating snow models and interpreting remote-sensing
	data. Until now, the size and type of snow grains have been estimated
	in the field. Nowadays, the transport of a snow sample in iso-octane
	allows laboratory analyses. The objective analysis of snow-grain
	digital images has been developed at the Centre d'Etudes de la Neige

	Finally a procedure designed to determine snow types from image analysis
	has been developed and calibrated using 65 snow samples. For that
	purpose, independent experts have determined the snow type (as defined
	by the International Classification) of each sample. The procedure
	has been verified using an independent set of snow images. This semi-automated
	determination gives 97\% correct results on granular-snow types.
	However, it is not reliable for precipitation particles.},

	abstract = {Vapor-transfer theory is incorporated into a previous firn-densification
	model to investigate the effect of vapor-transfer processes on densification
	in firn within 10 in of the surface. The densification rate in the
	model is governed by the change of overburden pressure (determined
	by the accumulation rate), the firn temperature, and the temperature
	gradient. The time of exposure to temperature gradients at shallow
	depths is a critical factor determining the importance of vapor-transfer
	processes. In high-accumulation and high-temperature conditions such
	as for the Greenland ice sheet, the temperature gradient and vapor
	transfer are less important due to the shorter exposure times. The
	high summer temperatures dominate the rate of densification and annual
	variations in density. In low-accumulation and low-temperature conditions,
	such as for inland Antarctica, the vapor transfer driven by the temperature
	gradient has a stronger effect on the densification rate, and temperature-driven
	processes are less important. These factors determine both the rate
	of density increase with depth and the amplitudes of annual variations
	in density with depth.},

	strategies to protect structures against snow avalanches. Since direct
	measurements of avalanche impacts on large obstacles are rare, the
	documentation and post-event analysis of avalanche damages is essential
	to understand the interaction of avalanches with obstacles. The objective
	of this paper is to develop hazard scenarios for avalanche actions
	on bridges, based on a case study of a well-documented avalanche
	event. The 40 m long pre-stressed road bridge Ri di Rialp in the
	Swiss Alps collapsed after being struck by a dense-flow avalanche
	in 1998. The post-event analysis shows that the controlling hazard
	scenario was an inclined avalanche impact, not a horizontal impact
	as one would assume given the topographical situation. Using a failure
	analysis, an impact angle of 40 degrees and a minimal impact pressure
	of 172 kN m(-2) were found. Finally the insights are summarized so
	that engineers can apply the results when designing a bridge at risk

	abstract = {In the Pacific Northwest of North America, significant flooding can
	occur during mid-winter rain-on-snow events. Warm.. wet Pacific storms
	caused significant floods in the Pacific Northwest in February 1996,
	January 1997 and January 1998. Rapid melting of the mountain snow
	cover substantially augmented discharge during these flood events.
	An energy-balance snowmelt model is used to simulate snowmelt processes
	during the January 1997 event over a small headwater basin within
	the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed located in the Owyhee Mountains
	of southwestern Idaho, U.S.A. This sub-basin is 34\% forested (12\%
	fir, 22\% aspen and 66\% mixed sagebrush (primarily mountain big
	sagebrush)), Data from paired open and forested experimental sites
	were used to drive the model. Model-forcing data were corrected for
	topographic and vegetation canopy effects. The event was preceded
	by cold, stormy conditions that developed a significant snow cover
	over the subbasin. The snow cover at sites protected by forest cover
	was slightly reduced, while at open sites significant snowmelt occurred.
	The warm, moist, windy conditions during the flooding event produced
	substantially higher melt rates in exposed areas, where sensible-
	and latent-heat exchanges contributed 60-90\% of the energy for snowmelt.
	Simulated snow-cover development and ablation during the model run
	closely matched measured conditions at the two experimental sites.
	This experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both
	climate and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is
	coupled to the hydrologic cycle in mountainous areas.},

	of speeds along the incline. Field measurements indicate that speeds
	and run-out distances are nearly independent of path steepness once
	a length is chosen to scale them. Application of granular-flow concepts
	explains these results. The most important feature of the model (and

	abstract = {Solar shortwave (SW) radiation is a primary energy source for the
	snow cover. Accurate measurements of the radiation energy balance
	in snow are not yet available over a broad spectral band. For accurate
	measurements in snow, sources of errors have to be eliminated such
	as the temperature dependence of some sensors, investigating a disturbed
	snow cover or neglecting the variation of the incoming radiation.
	The objective of our investigation is to measure the spectral SW
	energy balance in and above snow and to validate a radiation transfer
	model against the data. In July 2002 up- and downwelling fluxes at
	several heights in snow were measured on Summit, Greenland, with
	a spectrometer sensitive in the 340-1050 nm spectral band. Changing
	incoming solar radiation was accounted for by using two sensor heads.
	The resulting data are compared to the delta-Eddington model of radiative
	transfer in combination with Mic single-scattering calculations.
	Using as input the snow data obtained by weekly snow profiles, a
	good agreement between measured and modelled radiative fluxes was
	obtained when increasing the absorption in the snow grains which
	is justified by snow impurities. In the near-infrared a disagreement
	between model and measurements is obvious. This is most likely caused
	by non-sphericity of the snow grains.},

	and the Centre d'Etudes de la Neige of Meteo-France have been working
	on snowdrift for 10 years. A numerical model was developed at CEMAGREF
	to simulate snowdrift (Naaim and others, 1998). To validate this
	model on in situ data, a high-altitude experimental site was developed,
	located at 2700 m a.s.l. at the Lac Blanc Pass near the Alpe d'Huez
	ski resort. It is a nearly flat area and faces winds primarily from
	north and south. After describing the experimental site, we present
	the processed data of winter 1998/99. First, we analyze the data
	from CEMAGREF's acoustic snowdrift sensor. It is sensitive to snow
	depth and snow-particle type, so additional calibration is necessary.
	Nevertheless, it allowed us to study non-stationary aspects of drifting
	snow. An analysis of gust factors for wind and drifting snow indicates
	that strong wind-gust factors exist in the mountains, and that drifting
	snow is more important during a regular and strong wind episode than
	during high wind-gust periods. Therefore, the numerical model presented
	here uses only the recorded mean wind speed. The model, which attempts
	to reproduce several days of storm, takes into account the modification
	of input parameters (e.g. wind speed) as a function of time. The
	comparison between numerical results and measurements for a given
	meteorological event shows good agreement.},

	1996. This first dendrochronological study has permitted us to assess
	the tree-ring signals due to avalanche events in 53 out of 132 dated
	trees. The trees presented a variety of responses to the 1996 avalanche
	events. It is shown that the type of tree-ring signal depends on
	tree age. The methodology has proved successful in detecting the
	1996 and 1972 documented avalanche events, and provided outstanding
	evidence of undocumented past events such as one in 1930.},

	and others (1993, 1994) approaches are based on fluid-mechanics conservation
	laws where the snow is transported and diffused by the air flow.
	These models consider the saltation laver as a boundary condition.
	For the flow, and for the suspension, we adopt the same model as
	that of Uematsu and Listen. For mass exchange between the flow and
	snow surface, we have developed an erosion-deposition model where
	mass exchange is defined in relation to flow turbulence, threshold-friction
	velocity and snow concentration. Our snow-erosion model was calibrated
	using Takeuchi's (1980) field measurements. The deposition model
	was tested by comparing numerical results with wind-tunnel ones,
	for sawdust-accumulation windward and leeward of a solid snow fence
	with a bottom gap. The numerical results obtained are close to the

	experiments are: the leeward accumulation is very sensitive to the
	ratio (mu*/mu*(t))(it appears for (mu*/mu,(t)) close to 1 and disappears
	for (mu*/mu*(t)) > 1.2), the global accumulation produced by the
	fence increases as (mu*/mu*(t)) decreases and the back reaction of

	of 1995-96 proved that deciduous trees such as sorbs are effective,

	season because of the weight of snow on low branches. However, the
	use of natural plant barriers has disadvantages: a living snow fence
	takes time to reach an effective height and is difficult to establish
	on windy sites at a high altitude. This is a real problem. Therefore,
	in a second experiment, we studied the death rate of larches planted

	we studied the geometrical parameters of the drift. We conclude that
	changes in the cross-section drift area depend on the ablation length
	and if particle saturation is not reached, the use of a storm-duration
	scale leads to overevaluation of prototype storm duration. Moreover,
	we point out that drift pattern vary as a function of the concentration

	abstract = {Passive protection structures reduce avalanche run-out distance and
	hence the potential damages brought about by an avalanche, by reducing
	its velocity and mass. This paper starts with a summary of the main
	existing results on interactions between snow avalanches and dams.
	In the case of dense avalanches, the effects of dams are re-examined
	and previous results are theoretically justified. For a powder-snow
	avalanche a dam has two primary effects. The momentum is reduced
	by the retarding force upstream of the dam and when the jet collides
	with the ground after the dam. Entrainment of air during the jet
	reduces its velocity since the mass increases. For a dense avalanche,
	there is a retarding force upstream of the dam and when the jet collides
	with the ground, but there is no significant effect of air entrainment.
	There is, however, deposition of snow which reduces the momentum
	of the avalanche without affecting the velocity. The reduction of
	the volume due to deposition reduces the spreading length and therefore
	the run-out distance of the avalanche. Downstream of the obstacle,
	the avalanche flow is regarded as an airborne jet. A comparative
	study shows that density and ambient-fluid entrainment effects are
	significant for gravity currents, powder and dense snow avalanches
	whereas they are negligible in granular flows.},

	abstract = {The time evolution of drifting snow under a steady wind is estimated
	using a new numerical model of drifting snow. In the model, Lagrangian
	stochastic theory is used to incorporate the effect of turbulence
	on the motion of drifting-snow particles. This method enables us
	to discuss both the saltation and the suspension process. Aerodynamic
	entrainment, grain/bed collision (splash process), wind modification
	and particle size distribution are also taken into account. The calculations
	show that the time needed by the total mass flux to reach a steady
	state appears to be 3-5 s. Vertical profiles of horizontal mass flux
	near the surface show a similar tendency. In contrast, it takes >
	50 s for the wind speed and the whole mass-flux profile to reach
	a steady state. This longer time depends on the time-scale of the
	turbulent diffusion, which is responsible for the mass flux extending
	to an order of a few meters in height. Applying Taylor's hypothesis,
	the estimated length scale at which drifting snow reaches equilibrium
	is around 400 m. This result is comparable with previously reported
	field observations.},

	abstract = {First, wind-tunnel experiments were carried out to measure the trajectories
	of saltating snow particles with varying friction velocity. Trajectories
	of saltating particles were recorded by a video system with a laser
	sheet and trajectory statistics, such as ejection and impact velocities
	and angles, were obtained for each particle. Parabolic trajectories
	are considerably elongated with an increase in the friction velocity;
	impact angle was approximately the same but ejection angle decreased
	with increasing friction velocity. Furthermore, it should be noted
	that the gradient of flux decay with height decreased with friction
	velocity In the experiments, a snow-particle counter, which can sense
	not only the number of particles but also their diameters, was introduced.
	The flux distribution and the transport rate obtained as a function
	of the particle size gave a new insight into the relationship with
	the friction velocity. Trajectories of saltating grains were computed,
	using the measurements of the initial ejection velocities, angles
	and the mean velocity profile of the air. The results agreed reasonably
	with our measurements. Using the measured probability distribution
	of the ejection velocities, an ensemble of trajectories was computed
	and thence the vertical profiles of stream-wise fluxes. The exponential
	decay of the flux on height was obtained ill all cases and it supports
	the basic validity of the model, although agreement is less than
	expected.},

@article{OeKl2004,
	abstract = {It has been postulated that heavy summer snowfalls have a large impact
	on the mass balance of mid-latitude glaciers, because they simultaneously
	add mass to the glacier and reduce the amount of absorbed solar radiation.
	An automatic weather station (AWS) on the snout of Morteratschglctscher,
	Switzerland, registered a large summer snowfall event on 10-11 July
	2000. Sonic rangers recorded about 20 cm of new snow on the snout
	and about 50 cm near the equilibrium line. We have used data from
	the AWS to study the impact on the melt process. The data show that
	in the ablation zone of the glacier the snow has melted and the effect
	on the albedo has disappeared after about 5 days. The suppression
	of the melt by the high albedo of the fresh snow is an important
	effect. For the ablation zone we find a feedback factor of about
	four, that is, the total effect of the snowfall event on the annual
	specific balance is about four times the amount of mass added during
	the event. We have also used a mass-balance model with 25 in spatial
	resolution to assess the impact of the snowfall on the net balance
	of the entire glacier. NVe find the strongest effects just below
	the equilibrium line. Averaged over the glacier, the amount of snow
	deposited was 224 mm w. e. The calculated effect on the total mass
	balance of the glacier is 354mmw.e.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of sun-crust formation was investigated through laboratory
	experiments in a cold wind tunnel. The experiments were carried out
	by controlling the energy balance and the sun crust formed was consistent
	with that observed in Nature: i.e. a thin ice layer composed of ice
	particles and cavities due to internal melting beneath the sun-crust
	layer. The surface-cooling rate was between -50 and -100 W m(-2)
	, and the absorption of shortwave radiation exceeded 200 W m(-2).
	The energy balance during the formation of the sun crust is consistent
	with the data observed in Nature. The sources of H2O for the sun-crust
	formation were investigated through changes in delta(18)O. Taking
	into account that the delta value of sun crust was larger than that
	of the snow beneath it and the calculations of the latent-heat emission
	with the sun-crust formation, it was concluded that the retention
	of meltwater by capillary force and refreezing in a chin layer was
	the dominant mechanism of this metamorphism.},

	avalanche includes an unsatisfactory feature: the a priori selection
	of a midslope reference where the avalanche is assumed to begin decelerating
	from a steady velocity. there is no objective criterion for selecting
	this reference, and yet the choice critically determines the computed
	stopping position of the avalanche. as an alternative, a differential
	equation is derived in this paper on the premise that the only logical
	reference is the starting position of the avalanche. The equation
	is solved numerically for paths of complex geometry. Solutions are
	based on two parameters: a coefficient of friction $\mu$ and a ratio
	of avalanche mass-to-drag, M/D. These are analogues to the two parameters
	in Voellmy's model, $\mu$ and $\xi H$. Velocity and runout distance
	data are needed to estimate $\mu$ and M/D to useful precision. The
	mathematical properties of two-parameter models are explored, and
	it is shown that some difficulties arise since similar results are
	predicted by dissimilar pairs of $\mu$ and M/D.},

	abstract = {Melt-layer frequency and magnitude in polar and sub-polar ice cores
	have been interpreted as measures of past summer temperature, and
	calibrations have been proposed relating frequency of occurrence
	of ice layers in ice cores to past summer temperatures. But, observations
	in the percolation facies in Greenland and an analysis of the combined
	processes of meltwater infiltration and refreezing of water in snow
	indicate that, in addition to unusually high rates of meltwater input,

	initial conditions or early onset of melt. Uniform warming of both

	ice-layer formation in favor of uniform wetting and refreezing of

	a stratigraphic fine-to-coarse transition allows quantification of
	the effects of significant parameters initial temperature, grain-size
	and density contrast across the stratigraphic transition, water-input
	rate and minimum impermeable-layer thickness). Calculations are made
	to distinguish threshold values of parameters at which infiltration
	progresses faster than refreezing, resulting in a break-through of

	abstract = {The texture of snow has a great impact on the mechanical and thermal
	properties of a snowpack. The texture index (TI) is a new concept
	to quantify the texture of snow at the micro- and mesoscale, a scale
	at which the properties of snow layers are responsible for the stability
	of a snowpack. It is calculated by taking the ratio of mean grain-size
	(mm) of snow to density (kg m(-3)) of snow in a given layer. It combines
	a microstructural with a mesostructural parameter. An empirically
	derived TI is compared with a simulated TI for laboratory experimental
	snow and natural snow profiles. The TI was calculated throughout
	the development of three temperature-gradient snow experiments from
	laboratory measurements of grain-size and density. In a one-dimensional
	finite-element snowpack model (SNOWPACK), the development of the
	mean grain-size and density of these snow samples was simulated.
	It can be shown that the measured TI can be predicted by the modelled
	TI. Furthermore, three natural snow profiles from the Weissfluhjoch
	(Switzerland) test-field are compared with their simulations in terms
	of TI. This comparison reveals shortcomings in the measurement of
	fundamental parameters. It also shows the dependency of a good physical
	model on quantitative process descriptions at the microscale. The
	TI can be estimated using the force signal of the SnowMicroPen, a
	new high-resolution snow micropenetrometer. It is suggested that
	more accurate classical measurements combined with penetrometer measurements
	in the immediate vicinity of the snow profile will allow better verification
	of SNOWPACK simulations.},

	abstract = {Spatial statistics of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt rate were
	measured using spatially distributed, sequential ground surveys of
	depth and density in forested, shrub and alpine tundra environments
	over several seasons within a 185 km(2) mountain catchment in Yukon
	Territory, Canada. When stratified by slope/aspect sub-units within
	landscape classes, SWE frequency distributions matched the log-normal,
	but multiclass surveys showed a more bimodal distribution. Within-class
	variability of winter SWE could be grouped into (i) windswept tundra
	and (ii) sheltered tundra/forest regimes. During melt, there was
	little association between the standard deviation and mean of SWE.
	At small scales, a negative correlation developed between spatial
	distributions of pre-melt SWE and melt rate where shrubs were exposed
	above the snow. This was not evident in dense-forest, alpine-tundra
	or deep-snowdrift landscape classes. At medium scales, adja-negative
	SWE and melt-rate correlations were also found between mean values
	from adjacent slope sub-units of the tundra landscape class. The
	medium-scale correlation was likely due to slope effects on insolation
	and blowing-snow redistribution. At the catchment scale, the correlation
	between mean SWE and melt rate from various landscape classes reversed
	to a positive one, likely influenced by intercepted and blowing regimes,
	shrub exposure during melt and adiabatic cooling with elevation rise.
	Covariance at the catchment scale resulted in a 40\% acceleration
	of snow depletion. These results suggest that the spatial variability
	and covariability of both SWE and melt rate are scale- and landscape-class-specific
	and need to be considered in a landscape-stratified manner at the
	appropriate scale when snow depletion is described and the snowmelt
	duration predicted.},

	abstract = {A continuum dynamical hydraulic model for the flow of a finite mass
	of cohesionless shallow granular material down an inclined plane
	was proposed by Savage and Hutter (SH) in 1989. This model consists
	of depth-averaged equations for the time and space evolution of the
	velocity profile and the avalanche depth. Their model was generalized
	to incorporate more complicated topography in which the coordinate
	lines in the downhill direction are curved but not twisted. We present
	recently developed model equations by Pudasaini and Hutter for free-surface
	geophysical gravity-driven flows (e.g. avalanches, debris and pyroclastic
	flows) down complicated realistic mountain terrain generated by arbitrary
	space curves with slowly varying curvature and torsion. These are
	very important extensions to the successful SH theory, which incorporate
	curvature and torsion effects of the sliding surface. Shock-capturing
	numerical schemes are used to integrate the hyperbolic conservation
	system of equations. The physical significance of the numerical solutions
	is discussed.},

	abstract = {An assessment of possible snow changes in a changing climate for Finland
	is presented. The snowpack structure model SNOWPACK (developed at
	the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research) was
	used for calculating snow conditions at six different locations in
	Finland for the decades 1980-89 and 2080-89. Regional climate model
	(RCAO) data from the Rossby Centre, Sweden, were used as input to
	the SNOWPACK model. Ten years from the RCAO control run and scenario
	run Were chosen, and the snow conditions for different snow zones
	were calculated for these winters. The snow-cover depth and duration
	decreased at all locations in the scenario run cases, and the snow-cover
	quality also changed between the control and scenario runs: grains
	were bigger, snow was warmer and denser, and the fraction of faceted
	snow decreased while the fraction of icy or melting snow increased,
	even in mid-winter. Finally, the variability between different global
	climate predictions was analyzed. Significant differences were found
	between different climate-model outputs. The inter-model variable
	is comparable to the interannual variability of a single model. The
	qualitative Conclusions from the scenario run do not critically depend
	oil the climate-model variability.},

	abstract = {Historical snow-depth observations in the former Soviet Union (FSU)
	cluring, the period September 1960-August 1984 have been analyzed
	in order to understand the seasonal cvcle of snow coverage in the
	FSU. Snow cover first appears in September her in northeastern regions,
	and spreads over the entire territory before early January. Snowmelt
	begins in mid January in the southern regions and then snow cover
	retreats rapidly northward until it disappears completely before
	late June. Northward of 60 degrees N, the land surface is snow-covered
	for more than half the year. The longest snow-cover duration is observed
	on the central Siberian plateau (about 9.5 months) and along the
	Arctic coastal regions (about 8.5 months). One of the most conspicuous
	features of the snow coverage in the FSU is that the length of the
	snow-accumulation period differ considerably from region to region
	(2-7 months), while the length of the snowmelt period is rather short
	and uniform over almost the entire territory (1-2 months). Although
	the maximum snow depths are 20-50 cm in most regions of the FSU,
	they exceed 80 cm in the mountainous regions in central Siberia,
	Kamchatka peninsula, and along the Yenisei river valley. Values for
	the maximum snow, depth are very small along the Lena river valley
	in spite of the air temperature being extremely low in winter. By
	calculating correlation coefficients between the snowfall intensities
	and the sea-level pressures or 500 hPa heights, it is shown that
	deep snow along the Yenisei river valley is caused by frequent migration
	of synoptic disturbances from the Arctic Ocean. Snowfalls along the
	Lena river valley are also caused by traveling disturbances front
	the Arctic Ocean. Snow accumulation is suppressed after the Arctic
	Ocean has been frozen.},

	abstract = {The combination of numerical weather prediction (NWP) and snow avalanche
	forecasting has been performed using the output of two weather models
	run at the University of British Columbia, Canada, and a local numerical
	avalanche-forecasting model developed for Kootenay Pass (McClung
	and Tweedy, 1994). The main motivations for this work are. (1) to
	extend the lead time of avalanche forecasts by using NWP forecasts
	of meteorological variables as input to statistical avalanche-threat
	models (instead of the traditional method of using current/past observed
	meteorological variables as input); and (2) to create another tool
	to help avalanche forecasters in their daily decision-making by making
	true forecasts instead of "nowcasts" Therefore, verified weather-forecast
	model output was used as input for the local avalanche-forecasting
	model at Kootenay Pass. The resulting 24 hour avalanche forecast
	was compared to observed avalanche occurrences and to the 12 hour
	avalanche forecast with current weather observations. As a result,
	the avalanche-model output for the test runs with numerically predicted
	weather data is comparable in accuracy to the runs with observed
	weather data. The results also suggest that avalanches may be predicted
	statistically for 24 hours into the future when high-resolution NWP
	is used as input, weather- and avalanche-forecast errors taken into
	account during operational use.},

	is superposed by a powder-snow layer, a cloud of relatively small

	one order of magnitude smaller than that of the dense flow. A simulation

	The fundamentals of the two-dimensional granular flow model for the

	the powder flow are presented. Results of the complete coupled model,
	SAMOS (Snow Avalanche MOdelling and Simulation), applied to observed

	of powder-snow pressures acting on a tunnel bridge is briefly described.

	abstract = {Th e saltation length of aeolian snow particles and a new parameter,
	the ejection factor, which expresses the degree of erosion due to
	drifting snow, were obtained as functions of friction velocity by
	means of wind-tunnel experiments for semi-hard snow cover. The saturated-snowdrift
	transport rate was also obtained experimentally as a function of
	friction velocity. Based on these characteristics and the parameter,
	the development of the saltation layer of drifting snow along the
	fetch was simulated under various conditions such as snow hardness,
	wind speed and snowfall intensity. The main results are as follows.
	The developing distance denoting the distance required for the saltation
	layer to attain saturation, X-sat is determined by saltation length,
	ejection factor and saturated-snowdrift transport rate, all of which
	depend on wind speed. It is also affected by the magnitude of snowdrift
	transport rate at the starting point and by the intensity of snowfall
	if it exists. The dependence Of X-sat on wind speed is not simple
	in the case of semi-hard snow cover: X-sat increases with wind speed
	under weak to moderate wind conditions and then decreases under moderate
	to strong wind conditions. It is sensitive to snow hardness: it is
	about one order longer on hard snow cover than on semi-hard snow
	cover. Snowfall reduces not only the value of X-sat but also its
	dependence on snow hardness.},

	abstract = {The saltation-layer structure of drifting snow was investigated using
	the wind tunnel in a cold room. Experiments were conducted under
	various snow-temperature and wind-speed conditions over loose and
	hard snow covers. Snow was seeded at the upwind end of the wind tunnel.
	Mass-flux profiles of drifting snow were measured with a snow-particle
	counter. The theoretical expression for the mass flux of saltating
	sand (Kawamura, 1948) was fitted to the measured profiles, and two
	parameters in the theoretical expression, saltation height h(0) and
	mass flux at the surface q(0), were determined. The main results
	are as follows: (1) In the case of hard snow cover, snow particles
	are hardly ejected and drifting snow is maintained by the seeded
	snows The value of h(0) linearly increases with wind speed and decreases
	with snow temperature, and q(0) decreases with wind speed and is
	in proportion to seeding rate. (2) In the case of loose snow cover,
	erosion occurs under high-wind conditions and the contribution of
	the ejected snow particles to drifting snow is remarkable. The ho
	linearly increases with wind speed, but its value is smaller than
	the value over hard snow cover. Due to erosion, q(0) increases with
	wind speed. Snowdrift transport rate and q(0) do not change with
	seeding rate under low-wind conditions, because the drifting snow
	is saturated. Under high-wind conditions, however, both snowdrift
	transport rate and go slightly increase with seeding rate.},

	abstract = {Slush-flows of a large variety of magnitudes were observed during
	three field campaigns to Liefdefjorden, northwestern Spitsbergen,
	and one campaign to Karkevagge, northern Sweden. In the latter campaign,
	the release and movement of a slush torrent was documented on video
	and in photographs. Meteorological and snow-hydrological measurements
	carried out during these campaigns were analysed with respect to
	slushflow initiation due to snowmelt. Since slushflow are quite common
	in polar and sub-polar drainage basins (although they are not restricted
	to these regions), specific atmospheric and hydrological boundary
	conditions must be fulfilled for slushflow initiation due to snowmelt.
	Radiative fluxes, air temperatures and wind velocities are the most
	important atmospheric variables, while snow depth, depth of the water-saturated
	layer, hydraulic conductivity and snow structure are the primary
	snow variables of interest. It has been shown that slushflows can
	be released due to energy input in the snow cover by net radiation
	and sensible heat within the ordinary range of the high-latitudinal
	snowmelt period. Slush torrent initiation is intensified by a superposition
	of both energy fluxes. Infiltration losses were not significant even
	when permafrost was not present. Crucial for slushflow initiation
	due to snowmelt is the timing of energy input and meltwater flow
	through the snowpack.},

	abstract = {Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is widely used in soil physics to
	determine water content. Existing equipment and methods can be adapted
	to measurements of snow wetness. The main advantages compared to
	other methods are flexibility in constructing sensors, minimal influence
	on snow cover during measurements and sensors can be multiplexed.
	We developed sensors suitable for continuous and non-continuous measurements
	of snow wetness and density, measured the apparent permittivity in
	different snow densities and snow types, and compared the measurements
	to existing mixing formulas for mixtures of snow and air. In dry
	snow, density was measured from 110 to 470 kg m(-3). The residual
	error is 14 kg m(-3) and the 95\% confidence interval of our model
	is 3 kg m(-3). To measure snow density and wetness continuously suitable
	sensors have been constructed. Their small size and high surface
	area to weight ratio minimizes their movement in the snowpack, except
	when they are exposed to intense solar radiation. Results show that
	changes in dry-snow density of less than 5 kg m(-3) can be detected.
	Infiltration of even small amounts of water clearly shows up in the
	permittivity. At the surface of the snowpack, problems occur due
	to the formation of air pockets around the sensors during long-term
	measurements.},

	16-18 mm in height) taken from a so-called homogeneous layer (small

	Experiments were performed for strain rates between 7 x 10(-6) s(-1)

	Stiffness proved to be the most temperature-dependent property of

	strain and toughness decrease with decreasing temperature. Failure
	stress was found to increase slightly with decreasing temperature.
	The effect is not very distinct but close to statistically significant

	abstract = {In recent years, most avalanche fatalities have been due to dry-snow
	slab avalanches triggered by the victims themselves during recreational
	activities, at least in countries where recreational skiing takes
	place, as in Western Europe and North America. Simple analysis suggests,
	and previous measurements have shown, that the skier's dynamic impact
	is relevant for triggering, decreasing with increasing depth within
	the snow cover er and depending on the layering of the snow cover.
	The stress distribution below a skier in the snow cover is not known,
	but is important in view of the critical area required for fracture
	propagation preceding dry-snow slab avalanche release. The skier's
	zone of influence was measured with load cells buried within the
	snow cover in a level study plot for different depths. The size of
	the area of influence is of the order of a few 0.1m(2), but also
	depends on the weak-layer strength. Stresses in the snow cover below
	skiers who walk behind each other are not cumulative. The effect
	on the influence size is in accordance with the independent estimate
	for the critical size (0.1-1 m) for fracture propagation in the case
	of rapid loading. It supports the hypothesis that skiers induce a
	brittle fracture within the weak layer or at a weak interface between
	layers, leading under certain conditions to slab release, without
	necessarily hitting a pre-existing flaw.},

	abstract = {The release of a dry-snow slab avalanche involves brittle fracture.
	It is therefore essentially a non-linear fracture mechanics problem.
	Traditional snow-stability evaluation has mainly focused on snow
	strength measurements. Fracture toughness describes how well a material
	can withstand failure. The fracture toughness of snow is therefore
	a key parameter to assess fracture propagation propensity, and hence
	snow slope stability. Fracture toughness in tension K-Ic and shear
	K-IIc, was determined with notched cantilever-beam experiments in
	a cold laboratory. Measurements were performed at 3 different temperatures
	and with different snow types of density rho = 100-300 kg incorresponding
	to typical dry-snow slab properties. The fracture toughness in tension
	K-Ic was found to be larger (by about a factor of 1.4) than in shear
	K-IIc. Typical values of the fracture toughness were 500-1000 Pa
	m(1/2) for the snow types tested. This suggests that snow is one
	of the most brittle materials known to man. A power-law relation
	of toughness K-Ic on relative density was found with an exponent
	of about 2. The fracture toughness in tension K-Ic decreased with
	increasing temperature following an Arrhenius relation below about
	-8 degrees C with an apparent activation energy of about 0.16 eV.
	Above -6 degrees C the fracture toughness increased with increasing
	temperature towards the melting point, i.e. the Atrhenius relation
	broke down. The key property in dry-snow slab avalanche release,
	the critical crack size under shear at failure, was estimated to
	be about 1 m.},

	the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). We make
	use of the fact that when the accumulation and ablation process of
	the snow reservoir is modelled as a summation of a gamma-distributed
	variable, both skewed distributions, typical of alpine areas, and
	more normal distributions, typical of forested areas, can be accounted
	for. A particular problem is to represent fractional snow-covered
	area (SCA) within the distribution framework. The change in SCA as
	a response to a melting event is explicitly linked to the shape of
	the distribution of SWE and is estimated as the probability of non-exceedance
	of the melted amount from a scaled version of the spatial distribution
	of SAVE. An extensive snow-measuring programme, where several snow
	courses have been measured repeatedly throughout the melting season,
	justifies the dynamical aspects of the snow distribution in the modelling
	approach. The modelling, approach has been tested with the Swedish
	rain-fall-runoff model, HBV, and estimated values of SWE and SCA

	avalanche dynamics calculations contain a questionable simplification:
	they assume that avalanche mass is constant Ã¯¿Â½ meaning that no
	snow cover entrainment or mass deposition takes place along the avalanche
	path. This assumption is in clear contradiction to post-event observations
	which show that much of the snow cover has been eroded and that deposits
	are left along the avalanche track. The aim of this work is to investigate
	the influence of snow entrainment on avalanche dynamics calculations.
	A simple GrigorianÃ¯¿Â½Ostroumov type entrainment model, which assumes
	entrainment localized in an area close to the avalanche front, is
	introduced into a depth-averaged numerical model containing different
	constitutive flow laws. The snow cover distribution along the avalanche
	path must be specified. The results of the numerical simulation with
	entrainment are compared to existing Swiss calculation procedures.
	Six well-documented extreme avalanche events are used for this purpose.
	We find that inclusion of a simple entrainment model leads to: (1)
	a better prediction of runout distances, (2) a more accurate determination
	of flow and deposition depths and (3) a better control over model
	parameters; that is, the parameter range needed to calculate small
	and large-sized avalanche events narrows. However, one-dimensional
	models, as presented here, are limited because the flow width and
	therefore the potential erosion area, must be specified in practical
	situations by the user. This can introduce additional uncertainties

	abstract = {Since 1993 the Avalanche Centre of Arabba has managed a test site
	to determine avalanche-dynamics parameters (Sommavilla and others,
	1997: Sommavilla and Sovilla, 1998). The system is located on an
	avalanche track which is representative for the Dolomites, northern
	Italy. It monitors avalanche pressures, speed, flow height and variations
	of the avalanche shape and extent. In winter 1997/98, together with
	the standard measurements, a series of new field measurements and
	observations of the snow cover on the avalanche path were conducted
	for the first time in order to accurately determine the avalanche
	mass balance. The information collected is typical for dense flow
	avalanches which have small dimension and develop mainly along a
	channelled path. In winter 1997/98, four events were studied. For
	each event, in several sections front the starting zone to the deposition
	zone, manual measurements were carried out in order to investigate
	mass entrainment and deposition processes. The mass evolution of
	the avalanche has been determined. It is shown that the avalanche
	mass increases by up to 720\% with respect to the initial release
	mass. This entrainment process is related to the speed reached by
	the avalanche front. In addition, it has been determined that during
	the acceleration phase of the avalanche front the underlying snow
	cover is mostly eroded and there is no deposition of snow. In the
	deceleration phase, by contrast, erosion decreases progressively,
	reaching the value zero, while deposition becomes progressively larger.
	These results underscore the importance of the mass balance as a
	fundamental component in avalanche-dynamics research.},

	km(2) Swiss pre-Alpine catchment. Snow-depth data were analyzed with
	two different linear regression models, one including altitude, terrain
	slope, terrain aspect and canopy density, and one using altitude
	and simple land-use indicators. For the single measurement dates
	the first model was somewhat superior to the indicator model. The
	error term of the regression models showed only weak spatial dependence.
	Finally, a time-space linear regression model describing both the
	temporal development and the spatial distribution of the snow cover
	was fitted with the measurements of the first winter and tested with
	measurements of the second winter. The validation showed a satisfactory
	match between measurements and models in late December, but a slight
	overestimation of the measurements by the models in early April.
	In view of the models' ability to reproduce the snow-depth patterns

	At larger scales (10(3)-10(5) M), local (order 100 m) forcing continues

	seven zones of snowiness are distinguished, depending on the heights
	from sea level to the tops of mountain ranges. Data are taken from
	17 years of snow-avalanche observations. In a legend of a map the
	quantitative characteristic of the avalanching conditions for each
	zone is given. Interannual variability of snow depth is up to 100
	cm in low mountains and about 600 cm in the middle belt of mountains.
	The inversion of snow accumulation is registered. The frequency cycles
	of heavy-snow (3-4 years) and of especially heavy snow (10-12 years)
	winters are determined. The avalanche danger is provoked not by the
	total depth of the snow, but by the stormy snowfalls. The particular
	conditions of creation and development of nival processes are distinguished
	here: dry avalanches on the crests of mountains, wet avalanches in
	the middle mountains and slushflows in the low mountains. Despite
	low avalanche activity, avalanche risk is high due to the factor
	of unexpectedness.},

	abstract = {During winter 1999 three large avalanche events were triggered by
	explosives at SLF's avalanche test site, Vallee de la Sionne, canton
	Valais, Switzerland. One important goal of these large-scale field
	experiments was to measure the release and deposition volumes of
	avalanches by photogrammetric methods. In this paper, the photogrammetric
	measurements of all three avalanches are summarized. For one avalanche
	event it was possible to realize the whole measuring procedure as
	planned, and to obtain volume measurements before and after the avalanche
	triggering. In the other two avalanche events, the photographs before
	the triggering of the avalanche failed. Nevertheless the photographs
	taken after the avalanches provide valuable information on the fracture
	depth at the fracture line. The mean fracture depth of the largest
	avalanche was about 2.10 m, varying between 1 and 3.5 m over a width
	of > 1000 m. The total volume of the deposition of all three avalanche
	events was about 1300 000 m(3). The deposits are distributed over
	a length of > 1000 m with depths up to 30 m. The difference between
	the released and deposited volumes proved that avalanches entrain
	a large amount of snow along the avalanche track. Furthermore, the
	snow distribution in the deposition zone provides important information
	about the behaviour of a dense flowing avalanche in the runout zone.},

	abstract = {The snow-cover model SNOWPACK was applied to the wet-snow areas of
	Japan. Simulated variations of snow type, snow depth and weight,
	profiles of snow density, temperature and liquid-water content were
	compared with snow-pit measurements. The snow-depth Simulation during
	early winter agreed with the measurements, but the differences between
	the simulation and the measurements increased during the course of
	the melt season. These differences were caused by underestimation
	of the energy balance at the snow surface, mainly that regarding
	sensible-heat flux during the melt season. The underestimation was
	caused by the implicit numerical treatment of the heat-tran sport
	equation. Consistent with the underestimation of snowmelt, simulated
	metamorphosis of compacted particles into melt forms was slower than
	the change shown by the measurements, and faceted snow particles,
	which constitute a snow type not actually found in the study area,
	sometimes appeared in the model. The inaccurate melt treatment also
	influence d simulated densities, which were larger than the measurements
	at small densities, while thev were smaller than the measurements
	at laroe densities. Greater accuracy was achieved when all empirical
	compressive viscosiq forri-itilation for wet snows in Japan was introduced.
	A new version of SNOWPACK, with all accurate treatment of melt processes..
	is avallable.},

	abstract = {To complement a technique to detect internal structures of seasonal
	snow covers and glacier firn with ground-penetrating radar (GPR),
	we carried out calibration experiments and an observation of winter
	snow cover (5.7 m thick dry snow with numerous ice layers) with an
	800 MHz GPR. In particular, we aimed to discriminate periodic noise,
	which is inherent in GPR, from radar echoes and to obtain a relationship
	between the observed reflection strength and the magnitude of density
	contrasts. Experiments were done in air to evaluate noise levels
	and receiver characteristics of this system. Based on these, we removed
	noise from radar echoes in the snow-cover observation. We recognized
	numerous marked echoes in a noise-free radargram. The depths of these
	echoes coincided roughly with those of large density contrasts observed
	in the snow pit. Thus, we argue that the echoes correspond to thin
	ice layers. Furthermore, the minimum density contrasts detected by
	this GPR are found to vary from about 100 to 250 kg m(-3) at 1-6
	in depth in the seasonal snow cover.},

	use of snowpack properties; however, slab thickness (H), slab load
	(Load) and a skier stability index (Sk38) have proven useful for
	regional avalanche forecasting in the Columbia Mountains, western
	Canada. This study explores 21 meteorological, snowpack and elaborated
	variables including Sk38., H and Load. A daily, skier instability
	index (DSI) is developed as a response variable using skier-triggered
	avalanche activity on persistent weak layers and stability ratings
	at the end of the day. In rank correlation analysis, Sk38, Load,
	previous avalanche activity, H and some meteorological variables
	were highly ranked. The physical explanations are discussed. In classification-tree
	analysis, Sk38 was ranked as the most important variable and used
	in the development of the tree structure along with Load. Besides
	Sk38 and Load, snowpack thickness, the number of previously triggered
	avalanches and H have potential to predict DSI. Further we included
	once all 21 variables, and once all variables except Sk38, H and
	Load in nearest-neighbour models. Comparing the performance of these
