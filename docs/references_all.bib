	go back to the 1970s when premonitory low-frequency acoustic emission
	was observed in the snow cover just before the setting off of natural
	avalanches (Sommerfeld, 1977; Sommerfeld and Gubler, 1983). Recently,
	it has been demonstrated that avalanches also produce strong infrasonic
	vibrations in air during their movement. These infrasonic vibrations
	propagate great distances and can follow the natural relief. It was
	then a question of automatically detecting this emission to monitor
	avalanche activity, with a view to improving forecasting and assisting
	in the study of certain aspects of avalanche dynamics. With the double
	aim of pursuing investigations on the mechanics of the acoustic emission
	from avalanches and designing an automatic detection system, our
	laboratory has developed specific instrumentation, the essential
	link of which is an array of infrasonic microphones associated With
	a goniometer. Systematic measurements of the infrasonic emissions
	are being carried out, not only of the natural or released avalanches
	themselves but of all events with the aim of characterizing the former
	in relation to "infrasonic noise".},

	below the tree line followed a more normal distribution. During the

  journal = {Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics},

  pages = {117--129},
  abstract = {Predicting the occurrence and spatial extent of extreme avalanches
	is a longstanding issue. Using field data pooled from various sites
	within the same mountain range, authors showed that the avalanche
	size distribution can be described using either an extreme value
	distribution or a thick-tailed distribution, which implies that although
	they are much larger than common avalanches, extreme avalanches belong
	to the same population of events as {\grqq}smallâ avalanches. Yet,
	when looking at historical records of catastrophic avalanches, archives
	reveal that a few avalanches had features that made them {\grqq}extraordinary.â
	Applying avalanche-dynamics or statistical models to simulate these
	past events runs into considerable difficulty since the model parameters
	or the statical properties are very different from the values usually
	set to model extreme avalanches. Were these events genuine outliers
	(also called {\grqq}dragon-kingsâ)? What were their distinctive
	features? This paper reviews some of the concepts in use to model
	extreme events, gives examples of processes that were at play in
	extreme avalanches, and shows that the concept of dragon-king avalanches
	is of particular relevance to describing some extreme avalanches.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {363},
  pages = {1529--1550},
  abstract = {The idea that snow avalanches might behave as granular flows, and
	thus be described as Coulomb fluid flows, came up very early in the
	scientific study of avalanches, but it is not until recently that
	field evidence has been provided that demonstrates the reliability
	of this idea. This paper aims to specify the bulk frictional behaviour
	of snow avalanches by seeking a universal friction law. Since the
	bulk friction coefficient cannot be measured directly in the field,
	the friction coefficient must be calibrated by adjusting the model
	outputs to closely match the recorded data. Field data are readily
	available but are of poor quality and accuracy. We used Bayesian
	inference techniques to specify the model uncertainty relative to
	data uncertainty and to robustly and efficiently solve the inverse
	problem. A sample of 173 events taken from seven paths in the French
	Alps was used. The first analysis showed that the friction coefficient
	behaved as a random variable with a smooth and bell-shaped empirical
	distribution function. Evidence was provided that the friction coefficient
	varied with the avalanche volume, but any attempt to adjust a one-to-one
	relationship relating friction to volume produced residual errors
	that could be as large as three times the maximum uncertainty of
	field data. A tentative universal friction law is proposed: the friction
	coefficient is a random variable, the distribution of which can be
	approximated by a normal distribution with a volume-dependent mean.},

	downstream distance makes it possible to deduce the bulk frictional
	force experienced by an avalanche during its course. This derivation
	was applied to 15 documented events reported in the literature. Three
	types of rheological behavior were identified: ( 1) the inertial
	regime, where the frictional force drops to zero; (2) the Coulombic
	frictional force, where the force is fairly independent of the avalanche
	velocity; and ( 3) the velocity-dependent regime, where the force
	exhibits a complicated (nonlinear and hysteretic) dependence on velocity.
	During its course an avalanche can experience one or several regimes.
	Interestingly, the Coulomb model can provide predictions of the velocity
	and run-out distance in good agreement with field data for most events,
	even though for some path sections the bulk frictional force departs
	from the Coulomb model. This result is of primary importance in zoning
	applications since it makes it possible to deduce avalanche velocities
	from a knowledge of the run-out distance. Its physical meaning is,
	however, not clearly demonstrated in this paper due to the lack of
	suitable data.},

  abstract = {Avalanche dynamics models are increasingly used to estimate the features
	of extremely rare events for avalanche zoning. They employ a frictional
	coefficient, which reflects something close to snow viscosity. As
	this coefficient is more conceptual than physical, it cannot be measured
	and must be fitted by matching avalanche dynamics model results and
	field data. However, most of the time, the historical record is not
	long enough to fit this coefficient for extremely rare events. Here
	we propose a deterministic inversion method to obtain the probability
	density function of this coefficient. The method has been applied
	to two avalanche paths in the French Alps, each with a sustained
	avalanche activity over the last century. For applications the Voellmy
	avalanche dynamics model has been used with no loss of generality.
	It is shown that the friction coefficient is a random variable whose
	marginal probability distribution varies rapidly and exhibits two
	or more peaks.},

  abstract = {Avalanche hazard is a threat to many residential areas in Iceland.
	In 1995 two avalanche accidents, causing a total of 34 fatalities
	in areas thought to be safe, prompted research on avalanche hazard
	assessment. A new method was developed, and in 2000 a new regulation
	on avalanche hazard zoning was issued. The method and regulation
	are based on individual risk, or annual probability of death due
	to avalanches. The major components of the method are the estimation
	of avalanche frequency, run-out distribution and vulnerability. The
	frequency is estimated locally for each path under consideration,
	but the run-out distribution is based on data from many locations,
	employing the concept of transferring avalanches between slopes.
	Finally the vulnerability is estimated using data from the 1995 avalanches.
	Under the new regulation, new hazard maps have been prepared for
	six of the most vulnerable villages in Iceland. Hazard zones are
	delineated using risk levels of 0.2 x 10, 0.7 X 10(-4) and 2 X 10(-4)
	a(-1), with risk less than 0.2 x 10(-4) a(-1) considered acceptable.
	When explaining the new zoning to the public, a measure of annual
	individual risk that allows comparison with other risks in society
	has proven advantageous.},

	A new methodology to estimate the hazard component of avalanche risk
	based on the use of dynamic models is introduced. This approach seems
	to have some advantages over the current methods based on statistical
	analysis of historic avalanche data. The vulnerability component
	of risk is formulated as a function of avalanche velocity, according
	to previous formulations. However, given the lack of knowledge on
	how avalanche impact damages structures and causes fatalities, the
	effect on the resulting risk mapping of using different vulnerability

  abstract = {We test the behaviour of two statistical avalanche models and three
	hydraulic-continuum models of varying dimensionality against five
	reference events. For the hydraulic models, reference friction coefficients
	are produced that replicate the runout distance of the historical
	event. The model sensitivity to friction coefficients, release depth,
	release area and runout distance is also analysed. The hydraulic-continuum
	models yield similar reference coefficients on the simplest topography,
	but diverge for more complex paths, highlighting the importance of
	boundary conditions on model performance. The Coulomb friction (mu)
	shows a closer relation to runout distance than the turbulent friction
	(xi). For models of this type, the debris deposition pattern is useful
	for selecting model coefficients, rather than relying purely on runout
	distances. The results of the sensitivity analysis are site-specific,
	again highlighting the importance of terrain as a model boundary
	condition. The release area seems ro have less of an influence on
	model results than the fracture height and xi. In general, the models
	are most sensitive to mu. At the end of the paper, we propose a scheme
	for avalanche hazard zoning that integrates the statistical and dynamic
	models, such that zoning can be undertaken with some confidence in
	model output.},

	model relates the physical properties of forests (tree spacing, tree
	age, tree type, soil conditions) to avalanche flow. Modified dry-Coulomb
	and velocity-dependent friction parameters commonly used in avalanche
	runout calculations are derived. Example calculations demonstrate
	how the model can be applied to back-calculate observed avalanche
	events. The model quantitatively explains why large avalanches can
	destroy forests without significant deceleration. Furthermore, it
	shows why tree fracture consumes little of the avalanche's energy.
	Finally, the model reveals how protective forests in avalanche tracks
	can be maintained over time to provide the best protective capacity
	against snow avalanches.},

  abstract = {Snow-cover models are used in many applications in today's snow and

	problem in modelling the snow cover. Empirical models for kinetic
	growth under temperature gradients have been developed, as well as
	more complicated models based upon microstructure. In this work a
	simple, physically based model is derived which depends on one adjustable
	geometric factor only. Snow texture is described as a body-centred
	cubic lattice containing source and sink grains. The latter grow
	as plates due to water-vapour transport in the layer as well as between
	the layers. The model was implemented in a research version of the
	one-dimensional snow-cover model SNOWPACK. Model outputs are compared
	to experiments done in the cold laboratory where sieved snow is subjected
	to temperature gradients. Disaggregated snow samples are analyzed
	by digital image processing, by sieving and by visual characterization.
	In order to determine grain-size as objectively as possible, these
	various methods are evaluated for compatibility. The new model simulates
	very well kinetic grain growth for densities of 100-200 kg m(-3)
	and temperature gradients up to -200 K m(-1). The model will be incorporated

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the surface mass balance of a horizontally homogeneous
	snowfield, with emphasis on the effects of snowdrift sublimation.
	A one-dimensional model of the atmospheric boundary layer that includes
	snowdrift physics and thermodynamics is used. In sufficiently strong
	winds, snow particles are eroded from the surface. Once airborne,
	they are susceptible to sublimation. Averaged over longer time periods,
	the net erosive flux equals sublimation of snowdrift. However, model
	results show that there is no such balance in the course of a snowstorm
	event. They also indicate that snowdrift sublimation tends to enhance
	net erosion, but the increase occurs more slowly than the mass transfer
	by snowdrift sublimation, and the maximum is smaller. This difference
	in temporal behaviour influences the average erosion rate owing to
	non-linear interactions between snowdrift sublimation, drift density
	and erosion. Since the increase in relative humidity due to snowdrift
	diminishes surface sublimation, the average change in total ablation
	induced by snowdrift sublimation remains small. Observations made
	during snowdrift episodes in Antarctica agree qualitatively with
	some of the model results.},

	which the inherently stably stratified drift-density profile acts
	to destroy turbulence. This can be quantified by using an appropriate
	"particle" Richardson number, equivalent to thermally stratified
	flow. This Richardson number is proportional to the mean fall velocity
	of the particles (averaged over the particle-size spectrum) and the
	drift density, and therefore depends strongly on height above the
	surface. It exhibits a maximum close to the surface, where drift
	densities are largest. It then decreases to minimum values at intermediate
	heights, above which Richardson numbers increase with height. The
	particle Richardson number and the associated decrease in turbulent
	exchange coefficient depend strongly on wind speed, particle-eddy
	exchange coefficient and mean particle radius. It is found that particle-buoyancy
	effects in snowdrift are non-negligible for large wind speeds and
	large particle-eddy exchange coefficients.},

	in turbulence directly affects the vertical turbulent fluxes of momentum
	and snow particles (and other scalars), and can effectively be simulated
	by introducing an appropriate Richardson number to account for the
	stability effects of the stably stratified air-snow mixture. We use
	a one-dimensional model of the atmospheric surface layer in which
	the Reynolds stress and turbulent suspended snow flux are parameterized
	in terms of their mean vertical gradients (first-order closure).
	The model calculates steady-state vertical profiles of mean wind
	speed, suspended snow mass in 16 size classes and stability parameters.
	Using the model, the influence of snowdrifting on the wind-speed
	profile is quantified for various values of the initial friction
	velocity (which determines the steepness of the initial wind-speed
	profile). It will be demonstrated why the roughness length appears
	to increase when snowdrifting occurs. Finally, we present a parameterization

	We collected data from two adjacent parts of a slope 6 days apart.
	In addition, one manual snowpack profile was sampled each day, as
	well as 50 quantified loaded column tests (QLCTs) which provided
	an index of shear strength. For the SMP data, a 900 m 2 area was
	sampled on both days in a grid with points 3 m apart, with some sub-areas
	of more closely spaced measurements. We collected 86 SMP profiles
	on the first day and 129 on the second day. Our analyses involved
	manually locating layer boundaries and calculating statistics for
	the force signal through the surface-hoar layer. The shear strength
	index increased by 40\% between the two sampling days, but the SMP
	data show no statistical difference in layer thickness, and the mean,
	minimum, median, and a variety of percentile measures of the SMP
	force signal through the layer also do not change. Interestingly,
	the maximum hardness, and the variance and coefficient of variation
	of the SMP signal, increased. Since the small SMP tip might only
	break one or a couple of bonds as it passes through the weak layer,
	we interpret these changes as being indicative of increasing bond
	strength. Though we cannot specifically tie the increasing maximum
	hardness of the SMP signal to our QLCT results, our work suggests
	that the maximum SMP signal within buried surface-hoar layers may
	be useful for tracking increases in the shear strength of those layers.},

	including the coefficients of dry and turbulent friction and the
	coefficient of new-snow-mass entrainment was investigated. The Ã¯?`Â½DomesticÃ¯?`Â½
	avalanche site in Elbrus region, Caucasus, Russia, was chosen as
	the model avalanche range. According to the model, the fixed avalanche
	run-out can be achieved with various combinations of model parameters.
	At the fixed value of the coefficient of entrainment me , we have
	a curve on a plane of the coefficients of dry and turbulent friction.
	It was found that the family of curves (me is a parameter) are crossed
	at the single point. The value of the coefficient of turbulent friction
	at the cross-point remained practically constant for the maximum
	and average avalanche run-outs. The conclusions obtained are confirmed
	by the results of modelling for six arbitrarily chosen avalanche
	sites: three in the Khibiny mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, two
	in the Elbrus region and one idealized site with an exponential longitudinal
	profile. The dependences of run-out on the coefficient of dry friction
	are constructed for all the investigated avalanche sites. The results
	are important for the statistical simulation of avalanche dynamics
	since they suggest the possibility of using only one random model
	parameter, namely, the coefficient of dry friction, in the model.
	The histograms and distribution functions of the coefficient of dry
	friction are constructed and presented for avalanche sites Nos 22
	and 43 (Khibiny mountains) and Ã¯?`Â½DomesticÃ¯?`Â½, with the available
	series of field data.},

	A series of experiments was completed. It is shown that the basic
	mechanism of aerosol cloud generation for model avalanches is related
	to the hydraulic jump of fluid when a stormy flow changes to a calm
	one. A comparison of parameters for model and "home" avalanches (the
	vicinity of Elbrus) showed that the ratios of the sizes of dense

	close to the geometric scale factor and the ratios of velocities,

  volume = {26},
  pages = {343--346},
  abstract = {Even though the danger-level verification indicated in a bulletin
	should be a priority aim of avalanche-forecast services, there are
	no easily applicable verification methods available today. The main
	difficulty lies in the fact that avalanche observation is no longer
	sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to verify the actual condition
	of the snowpack stability, particularly concerning low danger levels.
	This work introduces a procedure for "a posteriori" field verification
	of danger level, both in space and time (24-72 hours). The method
	is based on the following elements: avalanche-activity survey, observation
	of cross-country skiers' activity, snow profiles and "Rutschblock"
	tests. These elements, relating both to time and the examination
	zone, are combined to provide an objective danger degree according
	to the European avalanche-danger scale. The method was used experimentally
	in the winter of 1993-94 in the Dolomites and subsequently, in the
	winter of 1995-96 in the Catalan Pyrenees. As far as 24 hour forecasts
	are concerned, the method has shown a forecast reliability of 93\%
	in the Dolomites and 76\% in the Catalan Pyrenees, while 48 hour
	forecasts have given values of 89\% and 64\%, respectively. The lower
	degree of forecast reliability in the Catalan Pyrenees is accounted
	for by the unusual weather conditions of winter 1995-96 which was
	very snowy and characterized by few foreseeable avalanche conditions.
	The practical application of the proposed verification method has
	given encouraging results, thus allowing experts to find the main
	errors in order to improve future forecasts. However, simpler survey
	procedures are necessary in order to operate on a regional scale.
	The method is suitable for further development relating to verification
	of both degree of danger and danger localization.},

  abstract = {In order to determine the viscoelastic properties of snow, torsional
	shear measurements were performed in a cold laboratory with a stress-controlled
	rheometer. Small samples (60 mm in diameter and about 7 mm thick)
	of natural snow collected from the nearby study plot were loaded
	in simple shear with monotonically increasing stress (stress ramp)
	and with sinusoidally varying stress (oscillation). The dynamic measuring
	method allows the deformation process to be separated into a time-independent
	part (elastic) and a time-dependent part (viscous). The applied torque
	is sufficiently small to prevent destructive deformation, generally
	permitting the true viscoelastic properties of a sample to be obtained
	over a large range of frequency and temperature. The limit strain
	for linear viscoelastic deformation was found to be very small (0.5-5
	x 10(-4)). Experiments performed beyond the linear range imply important
	textural changes (damage, breaking of bonds). The large strain reached
	during stress-ramp experiments showed that the ongoing damage process
	must be balanced by a healing (sintering) process. The usefulness
	of a rheometer was proven. It is a precise method for measuring with
	high reproducibility the rheological parameters of snow, and data
	gained with it improve our understanding of the deformation process
	under shear loading.},

  abstract = {Avalanche risk is considered as the probability of an avalanche event
	that could cause certain losses. A unified approach for avalanche-risk
	evaluation by statistical simulation is suggested. A chain of models,
	describing snow deposition, transformation, stability, avalanche
	dynamics and interaction with an obstacle, is used within such an
	approach. Each of the models evaluates a given situation in a deterministic
	manner, yielding a unique result value. Output data of each model
	can be the input for the next model in the chain. Uncertainty of
	input data is described in a probabilistic manner. Using the chain
	of the deterministic models and simulating the input data according
	to appropriate probability distributions with the Monte Carlo method,
	risk evaluations are obtained as the ratio of a number of certain
	types of outcome to the total number of tests. All kinds of information
	on weather, snow and avalanches can be used within this scheme. The
	simulation process can be started at any stage of the modelling.
	In this study it was started from the snow-cover stability simulation.
	Application of the statistical simulation in such a way gives an
	opportunity to reflect uncertainty of the initial data in the results
	obtained. The suggested scheme was used for producing a computer-assisted
	workplace for avalanche forecasting, "LAVINA', which has been exploited
	at the Centre of Avalanche Safety of 'Apatit", Kirovsk, Russia, since
	the early 1990s. It is an integrated system that permits spatial
	and temporal estimations of snow stability and avalanche dynamics
	to be made. Assessments of the validity of the risk estimation made
	with LAVINA are presented.},

  abstract = {Detailed data on autumn, winter and spring snow-cover conditions front
	remote areas are often difficult or very expensive to obtain. Therefore,
	an inexpensive method of digital photography was tested in high-Arctic
	Greenland. Automatic digital photography has provided daily data
	on snow distribution and snow depth for > 1 year from the Zackenberg
	area (74 degrees 30'N) in northeast Greenland. A standard digital
	hand-held camera (Kodak Digital Science DC50) was equipped to become
	automatic; it is supplied with an "automatic finger" and an external
	power supply and built into a protecting box with additional solar
	panels on top, in order to secure Continuous operation throughout
	the year. The daily photograph covers a 100 in transect through a
	seasonal snowpatch, and thus on an annual basis also yields information
	on snow-cover duration in the different vegetation zones of the snowpatch.
	The camera was installed in mid-August 1998. Photographs from the
	period mid-August 1998 to early September 1999 were collected and
	analyzed. All photos are taken at astronomic noon in order to use
	the daylight as long as possible into the winter season before the
	24 h winter darkness begins in mid-November. The digital photographs
	yielded the following information for the year 1998/99. The first
	winter snowfall occurred on 18 October; small-scale snow redistribution
	by snow-drifting started when the winter snow cover was about 5 cm
	thick. The continuous winter snow cover lasted for a minimum of 170
	days in the most snow-deprived areas downwind of the snowpatch, whereas
	snow in the centre of the snowpatch stayed on the ground for > 325
	days, turning the snowpatch perennial in summer 1999. Meteorological
	data obtained close to the photographed snowpatch site, in combination
	with the snow-cover depth and distribution data derived I from the
	photographs, show that at wind speeds (at 2 in height) of up to around
	6 m s(-1) only small-scale snow-drifting took place, when the snow
	cover was thin. Intense snowdrifting, however, took place at wind
	speeds of 8-13 in s(-1), particularly when enough snow was available
	in the upwind area. The automatic Continuous photography technique
	demonstrated here could be particularly useful in remote areas at
	high risk of avalanches during winter. It is an alternative to traditional
	snow monitoring achieved mainly by sonic sensors, snow pillows or
	manual measurements of snow depths. Likewise, it can provide better
	areal information than most standard methods, which give only point
	measurements.},

	Nevertheless, the results may be incorporated into snow-cover energy-balance
	models to improve the retention and percolation predictions. The

	of snow were obtained using X-ray absorption tomography. Images with
	a spatial resolution of 10 mum were taken on four different cylindrical
	snow samples (9 mm high, 9 mm diameter). About 1000 two-dimensional
	X-ray absorption images were recorded at angular positions of the
	object around an axis spanning 180 degrees. An appropriate algorithm
	was then used for these data to reconstruct a 3-D image. In the case

	and prevent both melting and metamorphism of snow during the experiments.
	This tomographic method provided 3-D data files from which images
	of 600(3) voxels were extracted. Several physical parameters of snow
	microstructure can be processed from these data. Porosity P and discrete
	local (3-D) curvature C of the grain/pore interface were computed
	for the four snow samples. Representative elementary volume (REV,
	in the sense of porous media) is a relevant index to the significance
	of the sample size with respect to a given parameter. From each image,
	the values of P and C are compared for subsamples of different size,

  abstract = {Measurements and observations by others indicate that a potential
	slab avalanche consists of a relatively cohesive slab of snow overlying
	a thin weak layer that contains flaws where locally the shear stress
	from the overburden is not fully supported. Under favorable conditions,
	snow will shear strain-soften, which provides the basis for applying
	a slip-weakening model to examine the size of flaw needed to initiate
	sub-critical crack propagation along the weak layer. Using typical
	values for snow properties: the model predicts sub-critical crack
	growth can initiate from a relatively small flaw well before the
	shear stress from the overburden approaches the peak shear strength
	at the bed. The occurrence of small flaws or imperfections in the
	basal layer would explain field measurements which usually indicate
	that avalanching occurs before the applied shear stress exceeds the
	shear strength at the basal layer. Widespread slab-avalanche activity
	often increases significantly soon after the onset of rain on new
	snow. Measurements of temperature and mechanical properties show
	that only the upper 0.15 m or less of the slab has been altered at
	the time of avalanching; alterations at the sliding layer have not
	yet been detected. Results from the slip-weakening model indicate
	that the rain-induced alterations would reduce the size of flaw needed
	to initiate sub-critical crack growth by 10-20\%. The observations
	and model results show clearly the importance of the slab properties;
	it is evident that both the slab and the weak layer act together
	to control slope stability. A further implication is that the stability
	of freshly deposited snow is often close to critical, because a relatively
	small surface perturbation is often sufficient to cause avalanching.
	This is not surprising, because it is well known from field observations
	that new snow on slopes should be treated with caution.},

	the dielectric constant of a given type of snow can be related to

	surface. Results indicate that avalanche deformation is concentrated
	near the running surface where the snow density is found to be largest.
	Upward from the surface, the velocity gradient falls off greatly
	while the density also declines. Finally, the dynamic-friction coefficient
	at the base of the avalanche was found by measuring shear and normal

	For a quantitative assessment of this process, a model is proposed

	ridge, based on input measurements of wind speed and precipitation.
	Since the topography is idealized, the model is focused on the snow
	mass that is transported over the ridge, and no statements are made
	about the exact snow distribution over the slopes. Three transport
	modes are distinguished: snow transport in saltation, snow transport
	in suspension, and preferential deposition of precipitation. Suspension
	is modelled with a one-dimensional diffusion equation, and for the
	saltation layer a newly developed model, based on the microscale
	physical processes, is implemented. The effect of speed-up of the
	wind over the ridge is included by assuming an analytical wind profile
	with a maximum wind speed at a few meters above the ridge. Advective
	effects are taken into account in a parameterization of the. turbulent
	shear stress profile. The model is compared with measurements taken

  abstract = {Avalanche-hazard estimation for the present and the following days
	is one of the main tasks of the avalanche forecaster. For 4 years,
	some have used the results of a series of automatic numerical models
	in the Alpine massifs of France. Thee programs describe in real time
	the main meteorological conditions (SAFRAN), the evolution of the
	snow cover (Crocus) and the resulting avalanche risks (MEPRA) at
	different elevations, slopes and aspects of the massifs considered.
	This paper presents the latest evolution of this automatic tool.
	With the new version it is now possible to provide 1 day forecasts
	of the state of the snow cover over the massifs of both the Alps
	and Pyrenees, including the main characteristics of the snowpack
	and an assessment of the corresponding avalanche hazards. To achieve
	this result, the main changes were with SAFRAN. Two combined methods
	are used within the same package: adaptations of larger-scale meteorological
	forecasts and use of observations of analogous weather situations
	from the past. These two approaches are complementary especially
	for evaluating precipitation where the second solution has important
	fine-scale information while the first exhibits important local biases.
	Validation of this new application was done carefully and proved
	the quality of the method, now used in real-time by local forecasters.
	We present some validation results, concerned both with forecasted
	precipitation fields at the scale of the massif and forecasted avalanche
	risks deduced from MEPRA.},

	presents experimental and numerical modelling of deposition processes
	occurring when a gravity-driven granular flow meets a fence. A specific
	experimental device was set up, and a numerical model based on shallow-water
	theory and including a deposition model was used. Both tools were
	used to quantify how the retained volume upstream of the fence is
	influenced by the channel inclination and the obstacle height. We
	identified two regimes depending on the slope angle. In the slope-angle
	range where a steady flow is possible, the retained volume has two
	contributions: deposition along the channel due to the roughness
	of the bed and deposition due to the fence. The retained volume results
	only from the fence effects for higher slopes. The effects of slope
	on the retained volume also showed these two regimes. For low slopes,
	the retained volume decreases strongly with increasing slope. For
	higher slopes, the retained volume decreases weakly with increasing
	slope. Comparison between the experiments and computed data showed
	good agreement concerning the effect of fence height on the retained

	of the Automated Indicator based

	Model Evaluation and Comparison (AIMEC). Computational snow avalanche
	simulation has gained

	importance in hazard mapping and mitigation planning. The simulations
	are based on depth averaged

	models operating in three-dimensional terrain, providing results such
	as flow velocity, depth and

	pressure. Complexity and large amount of results make an objective
	comparison of a high number of

	simulation runs challenging and difficult to interpret. Here we present
	applications of AIMEC, which

	has been introduced to: (1) effectively handle large amounts of simulation
	results, (2) provide

	mathematical definitions representing main avalanche features in a
	clear and comprehensive way, (3)

	provide the basis to evaluate deterministic simulation results by
	means of probabilistic methods. Key

	point of this method is a coordinate transformation in an avalanche
	path dependent system, which

	allows to introduce new metrics, the so called indicators. The indicators
	allow to directly analyze large

	samples of simulation runs with respect to e.g., the avalanche run
	out or destructiveness. Two

	examples show how to (1) improve model calibration by evaluating simulation
	results with field data

	and (2) compare the results of different simulation software, highlighting
	the influence of the different

	model implementations. The new method is helpful for the interpretation
	of avalanche simulations with

	a broad applicability in model evaluation, comparison as well as model
	calibration.}},

  abstract = {{The snow avalanche simulation toolbox SamosAT is used as a supporting
	tool for hazard mapping questions in

	Austria and some other European countries. SamosAT comprises two different
	model classes. A two-dimensional,

	depth averaged model for the description of dense flow avalanches
	and a three-dimensional, two-phase (air and

	ice particles) model for powder snow avalanches. The toolbox allows
	to compute and display the space and time

	evolution of the main avalanche flow variables such as flow height,
	-velocity or concentration from initiation to run

	out.

	On the one hand displaying the multidimensional data in natural terrain
	provides the basis for an intuitive result

	interpretation by the user. Clearly this is helpful for case studies
	and decision making. On the other hand the

	complexity and huge amount of result data makes an objective comparison
	of a high number of different simulation

	results challenging. This however is the basis of sophisticated model
	analysis and evaluation, such as sensitivity

	analysis, calibration, comparison to other models etc.

	Here we present new methods to analyze and objectively compare a high
	number of simulation results with respect

	to their practical relevance. Thus the variation of simulation results
	due to sources of variability and uncertainty

	can be displayed in a clearly arranged and objective way. The following
	steps are considered:

	• Automatization for SamosAT to enable a high number of simulation
	runs only outputting the relevant results.

	• Definition of avalanche quantities with practical relevance. Here
	the spatial distribution of the maximum im-

	pact pressure serves as a basis to define geometric (run out and shape)
	and dynamic (mean impact pressure)

	quantities.

	• Development of a technique to map the simulation results computed
	in a global coordinate system on a co-

	ordinate system aligned with the avalanche flow path. Thereby we achieve
	comparability and generalization

	for arbitrary avalanche paths.

	Finally case studies of the European avalanche test sites are presented
	employing the new methods. Release height

	variations as well as model parameter Monte Carlo simulations are
	investigated with respect to their influence on

	the result distribution. The methods presented here aim at supplementing
	expert result interpretation and providing

	the basis of an additional enhanced analysis for multidimensional
	models.}},

  abstract = {{SamosAT is a simulation toolbox for avalanches. It includes a model
	for dense flow avalanches which describes

	an avalanche as a shallow flow and can be used with various rheologies.
	Additionally a two phase air/ice particle

	mixture model is used to describe the motion of powder snow avalanches.
	The fundamental laws of mass and

	momentum conservation are the basis of the dynamic models.

	The initial mass distribution is one of the main input variables when
	considering avalanche simulations. Release

	areas and release heights are defined with certain rules found in
	literature. Snow entrainment and erosion along the

	avalanche path are important processes influencing the avalanche dynamics.
	When taking entrainment processes

	into account, the model equations of mass and momentum balance gain
	extra terms and parameters. Additionally

	entrainment areas and heights have to be defined. To this date the
	implementation of these processes in applied

	avalanche models is still work in progress. The two model types of
	SamosAT incorporate different entrainment

	possibilities. For the dense flow model, frontal entrainment (ploughing)
	or a shear stress dependent erosion can be

	considered. The mass of the powder snow avalanche is determined by
	a shear stress dependent flux function. Here

	the mass can be entrained from the underlying dense flow avalanche
	or directly from the snow cover.

	In this work the implementation of the different entrainment mechanisms
	in SamosAT is described. Furthermore

	a new ’mountain snow cover approach’ is suggested in order to provide
	a standardized method to determine the

	initial mass distribution when considering significant amounts of
	entrainable snow. This approach is based on the

	well known methods used to determine release heights in applied avalanche
	modeling. Finally well documented

	avalanche events are compared to the simulation results considering
	the different snow entrainment mechanisms.}},

  abstract = {Weak layers such as buried surface hear or depth hear frequently form

	Since it is difficult to transport samples containing a weak layer
	into cold rooms, the mechanical measurements have to be made in situ.
	We investigate strain-rate dependency of shear strength by measuring
	concurrently strength, deformation and acceleration, using a digital
	force gauge attached to a 0.05 m(2) shear frame to which an accelerometer
	and a displacement sensor are fixed. In doing so, a dynamic force
	comparable to a driving skier is applied. The measurements cover
	a strain-rate range 10(-2) to 1(s)(-1). The samples fail in a brittle
	manner. The shear-strength values cover the range 0.2-2.8 kPa. The
	dataset is also used to approximate the coefficient G, the shear
	modulus, for different weak layers. The snow structure has been analysed
	macroscopically in the field and for some layers representative snow
	samples have been extracted in order to prepare, in the cold laboratory,
	single-sided serial planes with cuts every 0.1mm recorded by video.
	The analysis of these snow samples should have given the relation
	between some mechanical properties (strength, strain) and the structural
	properties. Due to basic problems in defining the connection between
	complex snow grains (e.g. surface hear), we were unable to complete
	this part in due time. Only preliminary results on this aspect are
	presented here. Based on our long-term database, containing macroscopic
	structural and strength data of weak layers, a relationship between
	snow type and shear strength has been established.},

	component analysis, including the reflective part of AVHRR channel
	3, is used to estimate fractions of "snow" and "not snow" within

	on 17 January 2003 and successfully maps snow at sub-pixel scale.
	The detailed snow-cover information makes it easy to recognize the

	snow product. The sub-pixel algorithm reasonably identifies snow-cover

	of the avalanche leads to the flow of escaping air just in front
	of the avalanche that may disrupt the snow cover and support formation

	resemble those of the plowing mechanism. All mechanisms depend strongly
	on the snow properties, but, with plausible parameter values, erosion
	rates at or above the experimentally found rates are obtained. The
	entrainment rate of all avalanche is most often limited by the shear
	stress needed to accelerate the eroded snow to avalanche speed.},

  abstract = {Hazard and risk assessment in avalanche-prone areas involves estimation
	of runout distances of potential avalanches. Methods for determination
	of the runout may be divided into two categories: 1) methods based
	on statistical approaches such as the well known \ABM model or 2)
	methods based on numerical avalanche models such as the PCM-model
	or VS-type models (just to name the more traditional ones). Methods
	in the second group have the advantage that besides the runout distance,
	velocity and impact pressure distributions along the avalanche track
	can also be obtained, this being a requisite for meaningful risk
	assessments. However, the predictive power of dynamical models depends
	on the use of appropriate rheological models and their parameters.
	In the statistical \ABM model, the maximum runout distance is solely
	a function of topography. The runout distance equations were found
	by regression analysis, correlating the longest registered runout
	distance of several hundred avalanche paths with a selection of topographic
	parameters. In this paper, we re-evaluate Norwegian and Austrian
	avalanche data, which served as basis for the \ABM model in the respective
	countries, and additional avalanche data with respect to dynamical
	measures. As most of those avalanche data originate more or less
	from extreme events (i.e.\ avalanches with return periods of the
	order of 100 years), the dynamical measures may give hints about
	an appropriate rheology for dynamical models suitable for extreme
	avalanche events. The analysis raises reasonable doubt whether the
	classical ansatz for the retarding acceleration of snow avalanches
	with additive terms involving Coulomb-friction and a velocity-squared
	dependency, which is used in many avalanche models, is adequate for
	a physically-based model. Back-calculations of runout distances using
	a simple block model show a discrepancy between commonly proposed
	parameter values (and of the underlying rheological models) and the
	observations.},

	(e.g. from climate models or analyses) over the data-sparse ice sheets.
	Two series of snow simulations are carried out with two different
	meteorological datasets in input to the snow model. Both datasets
	are extracted from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
	meteorological analyses and forecast archives. First, the microwave
	signatures of the surface of central Greenland from the Scanning
	Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) are compared with the simulated
	density, grain-size and stratigraphy, The annual mean gradient ratio
	and polarization ratio, which are related to the emissivity of snow,
	are found to correlate spatially with these snow structural parameters.
	The sensitivity of the snow structure to differences in the two meteorological
	sets is then examined. It is found to be high for temperature and
	infrared radiation, precipitation and surface wind. The quantitative
	value of this result is limited by a still limited snow model validation
	over Greenland. Also, an optimal use of satellite data and a snow
	model for meteorological validation would require physically based
	translation of the simulated snow parameters into radiative properties,
	i.e. radiation transfer modeling.},

	It descended 2000 m and covered a distance of 5.5 km, with a rate
	of movement on the intermediate stretch of > 70 ms(-1). It killed
	two skiers following a valley-bottom piste, damaged a hotel, destroyed
	a wide belt of woodland on the opposite slope and caused other minor
	damage. The avalanche occurred immediately after a large rockfall
	on the southern slope of the Sperone della Brenva (3567 m a.s.l.).
	However, the relationship between the two events call only be considered
	indirect, since the main mass of the rockfall stopped at the base
	of the scar, on a large plateau oil the glacier surface. The rockfall
	and subsequent shock caused the contemporaneous detachment of masses
	of ice and/or firn from hanging glaciers at the head of a nearby
	cirque, leading to the formation of the avalanche. The complex mechanism
	of detachment hypothesized was induced from available documentation
	and from in situ investigations. Its phases also coincide with seismograms
	recorded at a station 45 km from the avalanche area. Finally, a mathematical
	model of the avalanche was used to reconstruct its dynamics and path.},

  abstract = {Snow avalanches threaten settlements and roads in steep mountainous
	areas. Hazard mitigation strategies apply numerical models in combination
	with GIS-based methods to determine run out distances and pressure
	maps of snow avalanches in three-dimensional terrain. The snow avalanche
	modelling system is usually applied to study single avalanche tracks.
	In this paper we investigate the application of a numerical modelling
	system for large area hazard analysis. We begin by briefly presenting
	the depth-averaged equations governing avalanche flow. Then, we describe
	the statistical and GIS-based methods that are applied to define
	the initial fracture depths and release areas for snow avalanche
	modelling. We discuss the calibration of the avalanche model friction
	coefficients for extreme avalanches in function of altitude, avalanche
	size and topography. Seven test sites with areas between 100 and
	350 km(2), that are well distributed over the different snow climates
	and elevation ranges of Switzerland, were used to calibrate the model
	by comparing the simulation results with historic avalanche events
	and existing avalanche hazard maps. We then show how the avalanche
	modelling system was applied over the mountainous region of Switzerland
	(25,000 km(2)) to delineate forests with protective function against
	avalanches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	avalanche events in a single track within a short time period. In
	addition, some fracture depths were larger than those used in avalanche-dynamics
	calculations. Therefore, the guideline assumptions for defining the
	fracture depths are questioned. Winter 1999 impressively underlined
	the danger of avalanches in mountainous regions. It emphasized the

	calculated by SAFRAN (estimation of relevant meteorological parameters
	for snow models) and Crocus (snowpack-evolution model) were analysed
	using an application called PROTEON. Forecasts of wind velocity and
	snow profiles have been used to discriminate between periods with
	or without snow transport. For the subsequent 24 hours and for each
	snow layer, the value of this snowdrifting index is calculated and

	topics in geosciences, they have received only limited attention
	in avalanche research. A thorough understanding of these issues in
	avalanche forecasting, however, is fundamental for the development
	of useful prediction models. After the definition of relevant terms,
	the different aspects of scale issues are introduced in detail. We
	present hierarchy theory (Ahl and Allen, 1996) as a potential framework
	for the multi-scale characteristics of the avalanche phenomenon.
	We suggest a temporal hierarchy, where the main contributing factors
	are ordered into seven levels according to their temporal-scale characteristics
	with respect to avalanche forecasting. Within each level there are
	individual spatial hierarchies, which result in a two-dimensional
	structure. This process-oriented framework is compared to the data
	classification scheme of LaChapelle (1980), which is based on informational
	entropy. Scale issues in prediction modeling and the consequences
	of the new framework for modeling efforts are discussed in detail.},

	(MODIS) snow-mapping project. The MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS),
	a 50 channel spectroradiometer, was flown on board the NASA ER-2
	aircraft. An objective of the mission was to determine the accuracy
	of mapping snow in different surface covers using an algorithm designed
	to map global snow cover after the launch of MODIS in 1998. The surface
	cover in this area of central Alaska is typically spruce, birch,
	aspen, mixed forest and muskeg. Integrated reflectance, R-i, was
	calculated from the visible/near-infrared channels of the MAS sensor
	The R-i was used to estimate different vegetation-cover densities
	because there is an inverse relationship between vegetation-cover
	density and albedo in snow-covered terrain. A vegetation-cover density
	map was constructed using MAS data acquired on 13 April 1995 over
	central Alaska. In the part of the scene that was mapped as having
	a vegetation-cover density of < 50\%, the snow-mapping algorithm
	mapped 96.41\% snow cover. These areas are generally composed of
	muskeg and mixed forests and include frozen lakes. In the part of
	the scene that was estimated to have a vegetation-cover density of
	greater than or equal to 50\%, the snow-mapping algorithm mapped
	71.23\% snow cover. These areas are generally composed of dense coniferous
	or deciduous forests. Overall, the accuracy of the snow-mapping algorithm
	is > 87.41\% for a 13 April MAS scene with a variety of surface covers

  abstract = {The reduced societal acceptance of living in regions exposed to snow
	avalanches, and the increased economic consequences when houses are
	located within a hazard zone, highlight the uncertainty concerning
	avalanche run-out prediction. The limitations of today's zoning procedures
	are especially pronounced in potential avalanche terrain where there
	are few observations of snow avalanches, where old buildings are
	present in the potential run-out zone, and where the local climate
	does not favour severe snow accumulation. This paper combines a mechanical
	probabilistic model for avalanche release with a statistical/topographical
	model for avalanche run-out distance to obtain the unconditional
	probability of extreme run-out distance. For the mechanical model,
	a first-order reliability method (FORM) and Monte Carlo simulations
	are compared. The interpretation of the statistical/topographical
	model either as an extreme value model or as a single value model
	is discussed. Furthermore, both a classical approach where the probability
	of an avalanche occurring is a constant, and a Bayesian approach
	with stochastic probability, are compared. Finally, example applications
	in hazard zoning are presented, with emphasis on how the influence
	of historical observations, local climate, etc., on run-out distance
	can be quantified in statistical terms and how a specified certainty
	level can be found from constructing confidence intervals for, for
	example, the most likely largest run-out distance during various
	time intervals.},

	hazard in Norway Knowledge gathered by the Norwegian Geotechnical
	Institute during 25 years of slushflow consulting and research is

	related to climatic premises and ground conditions. The principal
	ideas about slushflow release, down-slope propagation and run-out
	are outlined. They are closely related to the rate and duration of
	water supply, snowpack properties and geomorphic factors. Slushflow
	release is caused by basal shear failure aided by water pressure
	to cause loss of basal support and finally tensile failure through
	the snowpack. Our methods of hazard evaluation and acute-hazard prediction
	and warning are summarized, including the estimation of water supply
	based on meteorological data. The results of a worldwide questionnaire
	on slushflows, literature studies and scientific contacts, indicate
	that slushflows occur in all countries having a seasonal snow cover
	and that the results of our studies in Norway have a general validity.},

	of Scott Turnerbreen, Svalbard, was investigated during the spring

	in the snowpack and its impact on runoff chemistry. Dry snow contains
	420 mu eql(-1) of solute, is slightly acidic (pH 5.4) and is dominated
	by Na+ and Cl-. Wet snow is more dilute (total concentration 340
	mu eq1(-1)), and less acidic (pH 5.9). This is consistent with the
	elution of ions from the snowpack by meltwater. Snowpack solute can
	be partitioned into the following fractions: sea-salt aerosol, acid
	aerosol and crustal. About 98\% of snowpack solute is sea salt, yielding
	22 000 kg km(-2) a(-1). The behaviour of snowpack-derived Cl- in
	runoff is distinctive, peaking at over 800 mu eq 1(-1) early in the
	melt season as runoff picks up, before declining quasiexponentially.
	This represents the discharge of snowmelt concentrated by elution
	within the snowpack, which subsequently becomes relatively dilute.
	A solute yield of 140 kg km (-2) a (-1) can be attributed to anthropogenically
	generated acid aerosols, representing long-range atmospheric transport
	of pollutants, a potential contributor to Arctic runoff acidification.},

	of surface hoar or near-surface faceted crystals. The goal of this
	study was to obtain detailed information on T-s in different forest
	stands near the timberline. The investigations were conducted during
	clear nights and showed that the snow surface temperature is influenced
	very strongly by the forest canopy. While the air temperature was
	very similar on the different experimental sites, T-s was higher
	in the forest than in the open field; on the south-facing slope the
	difference between the forest and the open field was 3-4.5 degreesC,
	and on the north-facing slope approximately 3-7 degreesC. Taking
	into account that epsilon (air) is 0.7 and epsilon (trce) is 0.94,
	the incoming radiation (I down arrow) for the different experimental
	sites was calculated by the equation of Brunt (the canopy density
	was estimated using photographs taken with an 8 mm fish-eye). To
	calculate T-s, air temperature and averaged values of the net radiation
	(because the net radiation (I) has only a small range of variation
	during clear nights) were used. The results show that the calculated
	values were higher than the measured values (by approximately 2 degreesC).
	However, a better correlation was found by using lower values of
	the emissivity (epsilon (air)0.67 and E(trce)0.91).},

	Our investigations showed that the total radiation balance was negative

	about -30 to -40 W m(-2)) than within a small clearing (6 m by 6
	m). Moreover, the total radiation balance within the forest clearing
	was almost the same as that in an open field. There we measured -60

	(t(s)) showed that t(s) was below the dewpoint (t(E)) in an open
	field but did not reach t(E) in the forest; moreover, t(s) was very

	measures against rapid landslides such as debris flows, debris avalanches,
	rockslide avalanches, large-scale liquefaction failures, and slides
	of fill and mining waste. A continuum model has been developed to
	simulate the characteristics of these phenomena. The model is based
	on a Lagrangian solution of the equations of motion and allows the
	selection of a variety of material theologies, which can vary along
	the slide path or within the slide mass. It also allows for the internal
	rigidity of relatively coherent slide debris moving on a thin liquefied
	basal layer. The effects of lateral confinement are accounted for
	in a simplified manner. The model, is shown to compare favourably
	with results of controlled laboratory experiments and other analytical
	tools for several different materials and problem configurations.
	Examples of the practical use of the model to predict the runout
	of coal mine waste flow slides and flows of liquefied granular tailings
	are presented.},

	heavy-snowfall areas in Japan},

  year = {2004},
  volume = {38},

  abstract = {In heavy-snowfall areas facing the Sea of Japan, winter seasons with
	lower volumes of snow occurred from 1986/87 to 1999/2000. In this
	paper, the changes induced by these warmer winters in snowy areas
	in Japan are investigated using two datasets. One set was normalized
	for the period 1971-2000 from manned surface meteorological observations
	by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and the other set was for 1961-90.
	Winter climatic monthly values for the first dataset were thought
	to be affected by the warmer winter seasons since almost half the
	relevant period coincides with them. By comparing each monthly climatic
	value in both datasets, the following results were obtained: (1)
	At each meteorological observation site the bimonthly average temperature
	from January to February increased and the amounts of increase were
	about 0.4 degrees C on average. (2) The bimonthly maximum snow depth
	for the same period increased at a number of sites, but usually by
	only a few centimeters, the maximum increase being 0.05 m. (3) In
	contrast, the decreases in snow depth in heavy-snowfall areas facing
	the Japan Sea, which belong to a temperate climate zone, were large,
	ranging from about 0.05 to 0.22 m in climatic bimonthly maximum snow
	depth during January and February. The last result shows that snow

  abstract = {New categories for the climatic division of snowy areas according
	to their snow-cover character in mid-winter are proposed. They are
	a wet-snow region, a dry-snow region, an intermediate snow region
	and a depth-hear region. The wet-snow region is defined as the region
	in which every layer of deposited snow is wet due to percolation
	of snowmelt water throughout the winter. In contrast, areas in which
	the snow cover is dry, at least in the coldest period of the winter
	season, are classified into two categories, that is the dry-snow
	region and the depth-hear region. In the latter region, the small
	snow depth and low air temperature induce development of depth hear.
	The intermediate snow region was introduced to indicate an intermediate
	character between the dry-snow and wet-snow regions. From the climatic
	dataset calculated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency and from
	snow surveys, it has been found that in snowy areas; which have a
	climatic monthly mean temperature in January (T-jan) higher than
	0.3 degrees C, snow would be expected to be wet throughout the winter
	and, in areas that have T-jan lower than -1.1 degrees C, to be dry
	at least in the coldest period. Snow covers, where T-jan is between
	these two values, are expected to have intermediate characters. Therefore,
	these temperatures are supposed to be critical values among the wet,
	dry and intermediate snow regions. The criterion that separates the
	depth-hoar region from the dry-snow areas was found to be given by
	a climatic mean temperature gradient. This value lies between 10
	degrees and 12 degrees Cm which is derived by dividing the absolute
	value of the average of the climatic monthly mean air temperature,
	which is always below 0 degrees C, by the average of the monthly
	maximum snow depth during January and February.},

	In the suspension layer, the mass- and momentum-balance equations
	for the mixture are supplemented by the snow mass balance and the
	transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation.
	Mass and momentum exchange between the two layers is determined by
	particle settling, turbulent diffusion against the concentration
	gradient and aerodynamic shear forces. The net erosion or deposition
	rate is a function of the kinetic energy of the impacting particles.
	The saltation layer reacts on the suspension layer in that saltating
	particles extract momentum from the air flow. The preliminary estimates
	of the model parameters can be refined by means of saltation-trajectory
	simulations. Three-dimensional simulations with a simplified model

	are widely used to protect residential areas and other kinds of infrastructure.
	The effect of the defence structures depends largely on their effective
	height relative to the velocity, volume and flow depth of the avalanche.
	Snow depositions from earlier avalanches as well as from drifting
	snow can significantly alter the effective height of defence structures.
	Different designs of avalanche-breaking mounds and retarding dams
	were tested in the Cemagref (Grenoble, France) wind tunnel for their
	effect on drifting snow. Examples included dams and mounds of different
	sizes and heights. The models were tested in a wind tunnel with sand
	particles subjected to different wind directions. The resulting depositions
	were scanned with a laser system to obtain a three-dimensional picture
	of the accumulation pattern. The results show that the accumulated
	snow varies widely with the design of the structure for a given wind
	direction. Most snow is accumulated around narrow mounds, with least
	accumulation observed around mounds covering a smaller relative area
	of the avalanche path. The data obtained can be used to study the
	effect of the depositions on the retarding effect of the avalanche
	defence structures. However, because the similarity criteria for
	studying the interaction between structures and saltating particles
	in a wind tunnel cannot be met, the transfer of the results to reality

	a buried weak snowpack layer. Using a force gauge, the frame is pulled
	until a fracture occurs in the weak layer within I s. The strength
	is calculated from the maximum force divided by the area of the frame.
	Finite-element studies show that the shear stress in the weak layer
	is concentrated below the cross-members that subdivide the frame
	and where the weak layer is notched at the front and back of the
	frame. Placing the bottom of the frame in the weak layer increases
	the stress concentrations, and results in significantly lower strength
	measurements than placing the bottom of the frame a few mm above
	the weak layer. Based on over 800 sets of 7-12 tests in western Canada,
	coefficients of variation average 14\% and 18\% from level study
	plots and avalanche start zones, respectively. Consequently, sets
	of 12 tests typically yield a precision of the mean of 10\% with
	95\% confidence. which is sufficient for monitoring of strength change
	of weak layers over time in study plots. With consistent technique,
	there is no significant difference in mean strength measurements
	obtained by different experienced shear frame operators using the
	same approximate loading rate and technique for placing the frame.
	Although fracture surfaces are usually planar, only one of eleven
	shapes of non-planar fracture surfaces showed significantly different
	strength compared to planar fracture surfaces. For weak layers thick
	enough for density measurements, the shear strength is plotted against
	density and grain form. From these data, empirical equations are
	determined to estimate the shear strength of weak snowpack layers.},

	Iceland, after the catastrophic avalanche accident on 26 October
	1995 when 20 people were killed. Both deflectors have since been
	hit by moderately large avalanches, in each case with a volume of
	> 100 000m(3) and an estimated return period of 10-30 years. The
	avalanches hit the deflectors with deflecting angles of 20-25 degrees
	and a maximum run-up of 12-13 m. They flowed about 500 in along the
	deflectors after the initial impact and terminated in the ocean on
	the respective sides of the reef where the village is situated. Back-calculated
	impact velocities are of the order of 30 m s(-1). In both cases,
	the impact channelized a part of or the whole of the width of the
	avalanche into a stream 20-80 m wide, the run-out of which is estimated
	to have been increased by > 100 m by the deflection of the avalanche
	by the dam. Although the avalanches are much smaller than the design
	avalanches of the deflecting dams, they have provided avalanche professionals
	and the public in Iceland With Much welcomed direct evidence of the
	effectiveness of the defence structures at Flateyri against moderately
	sized events. They also provide unique direct observations for further

	evolution of microstructure and its effect on continuum-scale deformation
	for the constant-speed uniaxial-strain compaction of an aggregate
	of roughly spherical elastic-plastic particles. Simulation results
	are used to explain some micromechanical aspects of snow compaction.
	Different compaction rates were used to examine the limits of quasi-static
	response and the effects of inertial stresses. Four stages of microstructurally
	controlled compaction were observed for quasi-static loading: particle
	re-arrangement, elastic deformation and two stages of plastic deformation.
	Elastic deformation follows the first critical density caused by
	the stable random loose-particle packing of rough spheres. Stage
	III compaction occurs by plastic deformation once stresses acting
	on particles exceed yield. Stage IV compaction follows a second critical
	density caused by the stable packing of deformed particles and is
	also through plastic deformation of particles. During high-sped compaction,
	inertial stresses propagate particle deformation from the loading
	platen into the aggregate. as a consequence, particle re-arrangement
	is limited so that the pressure density ratio is larger for high-speed
	compaction than for quasi-static compaction at the same density.
	Hence, critical densities and the compaction-rate dependence of the
	pressure-density ratio during compaction of an aggregate of particles
	composed of rate-independent material are;determined by the evolution
	of microstructure at different compaction rates. Observed pressure-density
	profiles for polar snow exhibit the same features of critical density
	and changes in the pressure-density ratio as found in the simulation
	and consist of four compaction stages: particle re-arrangement and
	three stages of cr eep particle deformation each following a critical
	density. Shear stresses appear to enhance the compaction during the
	stage III creep deformation of snow.},

	runout ratios from the four mountain ranges are well fit by an extreme-value
	type I (Gumbel) distribution when the beta point is defined at the
	uppermost point where the slope is 24 degrees. A second model was
	developed by regressing the a angle for the extreme runout position
	on numerous terrain variables. This regression model uses three predictor
	variables that can be easily measured in the field or on topographic
	maps. Length-scale effects were noted in both models, but are more
	pronounced in the runout ratio model. A comparison of models developed
	using the two methods shows that the runout ratio model estimates
	more conservative (longer) runout distances than the regression model
	for most threshold probabilities. Data from 13 additional paths from
	Switzerland and Quebec, Canada, are used to test the models.},

	satellite passive-microwave observations are based on point measurements
	of SWE or extrapolation of point measurements to the 30 km footprint
	of the satellite observations. SWE observations on a scale comparable
	to the satellite observations can be obtained from airborne gamma-ray
	attenuation techniques from flight lines that are approximately 10
	km long. During the winter of 1989, the NOAA National Operational
	Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) flew 92 of these flight
	lines over a 200 x 250 km area of the Red River basin which is located
	in the north-central part of the United States of America. These
	observations provide a unique dataset of snow water-equivalent determinations
	on spatial scales similar to the satellite passive-microwave observations
	as acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
	Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) F-8 satellite. Land-classification
	determinations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
	(AVHRR) show that the eastern part of the region contains a coniferous
	forest of varying coverage, while the remainder is farmland or prairie.
	SSM/I data, including observations from a no-snow case in the preceding
	fall, the flight-line data and the AVHRR data were all co-registered
	to a common 20 km grid. The resulting dataset tvas analyzed using
	linear regression, artificial intelligence and general linear models.
	The results showed that the passive-micro-wave response was similar
	to the response predicted by Mie scattering theory. A comparison
	of the three techniques found that the artificial intelligence technique
	and the general linear model explained significantly more of the
	variance in the dataset, as evidenced by R-2 values of 0.97 compared
	to 0.88 for the linear multiple-regression analysis. Hence, a neural
	network approach which was continually trained on new datasets as
	they became available, could provide better estimates of snowpack
	water equivalent than algorithms based on linear-regression techniques.},

	soil temperature measurements were carried out on the ski slope and
	off-piste during winter 1999/2000. The numerical soil-vegetation-atmosphere
	transfer model COUP was run for both locations, with a new option
	to simulate the snowpack development on a groomed ski slope. Snow
	density. snow hardness and thermal conductivity were significantly
	higher on the ski slope than in the natural snowpack. However, these
	differences did rift affect the cooling of the soil, since no difference
	was observed between the ski slope and the natural snow cover. This
	might be because cold periods were rare and short and thus any snowpack
	could protect the soil from freezing. The major impact of the ski-slope
	grooming was a 4 week delay in snowmelt and soil warming at the end
	of the season. The newly implemented option proved to be a useful
	strategy for simulating the snowpack of a ski slope. However, snow
	density was underestimated by the model as it could not account adequately
	for compaction due to grooming traffic. Our study demonstrates that
	there is no site-independent answer as to whether a groomed snowpack
	affects the thermal conditions in the soil.},

  abstract = {Heavy rain on snow often leads to disastrous damages in torrent watersheds.
	In January 1998 a project was started to investigate "runoff and
	infiltration characteristics of different alpine soil/vegetation
	units under snow cover". One aim was to determine the runoff rates
	from snow-covered, differently cultivated soil/vegetation units (pastures,
	dwarf-shrub stands, forests), especially under conditions of sparse
	snow cover and frozen soil. Differences in runoff formation between
	artificially snowed skiing areas and plots with natural snow cover
	were also of interest. Heavy rain (intensity 100 mm h(-1)) was simulated
	on four plots by using a transportable spray irrigation installation.
	The investigations showed runoff coefficients of 0.4-0.7. The lowest
	runoff values were found where the soil under snow cover was not
	frozen, but even on these stands the runoff coefficient exceeded
	0.4. Snow depth and runoff delay are strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.8).
	An increment in snow of 10 cm is followed by a runoff delay of 3.6
	min. Divergences from this coherence are due to the composition of
	the snowpack, especially in case of artificial snow. This result
	is encouraged by runoff simulations performed for the irrigated plots
	by use of a hydrological model.},

	using hourly data of total snow depth and precipitation. As the snow
	cover is compacted continuously due to its own weight, the depth
	of new snow deposited since the previous time-seep to the present
	time is given by a difference between the height of the present snow
	surface and the present compacted height of the previous snow surface.
	Thus, based on viscous compression theory and an empirical relation
	between compressive viscosity and the density of snow, an equation
	has been derived to compute the time variation of the thickness of
	a snow layer due to viscous compression. Using this equation, the
	present height of the previous snow surface, which cannot be measured
	by simple means, was computed and the depth of daily new snow was
	estimated as its difference from the present measured total snow
	depth. The approximated results were found to be in good agreement
	with data measured in Tohkamachi during the three winters from 1992-93
	to 1991-95. The standard deviation was 1.71 cm and the maximum difference
	between estimated values and observed values was +/- 8 cm.},

	Ice Shelf, relatively large amounts of snow and ice were cleared

	amount of material remains adjacent to the runway in two north-south
	extending mounds (berms). The runway was originally constructed on
	an experimental basis so attention was not focused on developing
	and executing a snow-removal/accumulation plan. After the runway
	was successfully constructed and supporting routine flight operations,
	concern developed over the possibility of snow accumulation adjacent
	to the berm area eventually inundating the runway. The intent of
	this project was to analyze snow accumulation and to recommend passive
	methods for removing some of the berm material and snow adjacent
	to the berm. We found that large quantities of excess snow could
	be removed by use of vortex fences which cause erosion on the leeward
	side of the fence. The vortex fence was designed to be portable (unlike
	traditional jet or blower fences) and self-orienting into the wind
	to allow snow removal regardless of the wind direction. The vortices
	generated by the fence do not dissipate rapidly, providing effective
	and sustained erosion.},

	with a retaining structure. On both poles, strain gauges were mounted
	in pairs every 0.5 m to find the axial stresses and the moments in
	different sections. In the middle section of the retaining structure,
	the beams and supporters were instrumented to obtain measurements
	of the strains and stresses. Snow glide was controlled by glide shoes
	mounted at the rock surface above the structures. During the winter,
	snow profiles were made systematically; these included measurements
	of snow depth, density and temperature, and observations of snow
	type and moisture content. By relating the measured stresses and
	moments in the structures to the snow depth, it was possible to find
	the snow-pressure distribution. A comparison of the snow pressures
	with the "Body force index" (product of snow depth h, density p and
	acceleration due to gravity g), show a close relationship for the
	wall element. For the pole elements, the snow temperature during
	the winter is an added factor of high importance and the highest
	pressures on these elements occur in winters with long periods of

  abstract = {SNOWPACK has been in operational use for five consecutive winters
	on approximately 100 automatic weather stations in the Swiss Alps.
	It calculates snow precipitation, snowdrift and the layered structure
	of the snow cover. An analysis routine has been implemented that
	gives a stability estimation for a model profile. We distinguish
	between slab instability and direct action or deformation-rate instability.
	Slab instability relies on a static force balance within the snowpack
	(stability index) and may be used to assess stability for both natural
	and skier-triggered slab avalanches. We heuristically improve the
	slab index by adding a term of overload correction for all grain
	types and scaling the stability index with the bond size. Deformation-rate
	instability means that the load of the snow cover increases faster
	than the snow gains strength. An index is formulated based on the
	snow deformation rate. It may be associated with large snowfall events
	and wet-snow situations as they occur in catastrophic situations,
	or with the effect of a sudden increase in temperature. The results
	of both stability indices are compared to the forecasted avalanche
	danger. The indices are able to recognize cases of avalanching. It
	is shown that the inclusion of several locations, for which the indices
	are calculated, improves the correlation between stability indices
	and avalanche danger. A sufficient number of profiles could bridge
	the gap between snow-cover characteristics at a point and avalanche
	danger.},

	software-systems have been uraded, allowing quicker and easier analyses.
	Finally a procedure designed to determine snow types from image analysis
	has been developed and calibrated using 65 snow samples. For that
	purpose, independent experts have determined the snow type (as defined
	by the International Classification) of each sample. The procedure
	has been verified using an independent set of snow images. This semi-automated

	variations in density. In low-accumulation and low-temperature conditions,
	such as for inland Antarctica, the vapor transfer driven by the temperature
	gradient has a stronger effect on the densification rate, and temperature-driven

	analysis, an impact angle of 40 degrees and a minimal impact pressure
	of 172 kN m(-2) were found. Finally the insights are summarized so

	An energy-balance snowmelt model is used to simulate snowmelt processes
	during the January 1997 event over a small headwater basin within
	the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed located in the Owyhee Mountains
	of southwestern Idaho, U.S.A. This sub-basin is 34\% forested (12\%
	fir, 22\% aspen and 66\% mixed sagebrush (primarily mountain big
	sagebrush)), Data from paired open and forested experimental sites
	were used to drive the model. Model-forcing data were corrected for
	topographic and vegetation canopy effects. The event was preceded
	by cold, stormy conditions that developed a significant snow cover
	over the subbasin. The snow cover at sites protected by forest cover
	was slightly reduced, while at open sites significant snowmelt occurred.
	The warm, moist, windy conditions during the flooding event produced
	substantially higher melt rates in exposed areas, where sensible-
	and latent-heat exchanges contributed 60-90\% of the energy for snowmelt.
	Simulated snow-cover development and ablation during the model run
	closely matched measured conditions at the two experimental sites.
	This experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both
	climate and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is

	such as snow poles, three columns of snow collectors (prismatic boxes)

	4 years of data acquisition, the thickness of the snowdrift has been

	explains these results. The most important feature of the model (and

  abstract = {Solar shortwave (SW) radiation is a primary energy source for the
	snow cover. Accurate measurements of the radiation energy balance
	in snow are not yet available over a broad spectral band. For accurate
	measurements in snow, sources of errors have to be eliminated such
	as the temperature dependence of some sensors, investigating a disturbed
	snow cover or neglecting the variation of the incoming radiation.
	The objective of our investigation is to measure the spectral SW
	energy balance in and above snow and to validate a radiation transfer
	model against the data. In July 2002 up- and downwelling fluxes at
	several heights in snow were measured on Summit, Greenland, with
	a spectrometer sensitive in the 340-1050 nm spectral band. Changing
	incoming solar radiation was accounted for by using two sensor heads.
	The resulting data are compared to the delta-Eddington model of radiative
	transfer in combination with Mic single-scattering calculations.
	Using as input the snow data obtained by weekly snow profiles, a
	good agreement between measured and modelled radiative fluxes was
	obtained when increasing the absorption in the snow grains which
	is justified by snow impurities. In the near-infrared a disagreement
	between model and measurements is obvious. This is most likely caused
	by non-sphericity of the snow grains.},

	to simulate snowdrift (Naaim and others, 1998). To validate this
	model on in situ data, a high-altitude experimental site was developed,
	located at 2700 m a.s.l. at the Lac Blanc Pass near the Alpe d'Huez
	ski resort. It is a nearly flat area and faces winds primarily from
	north and south. After describing the experimental site, we present
	the processed data of winter 1998/99. First, we analyze the data
	from CEMAGREF's acoustic snowdrift sensor. It is sensitive to snow
	depth and snow-particle type, so additional calibration is necessary.
	Nevertheless, it allowed us to study non-stationary aspects of drifting
	snow. An analysis of gust factors for wind and drifting snow indicates
	that strong wind-gust factors exist in the mountains, and that drifting
	snow is more important during a regular and strong wind episode than
	during high wind-gust periods. Therefore, the numerical model presented
	here uses only the recorded mean wind speed. The model, which attempts
	to reproduce several days of storm, takes into account the modification
	of input parameters (e.g. wind speed) as a function of time. The
	comparison between numerical results and measurements for a given
	meteorological event shows good agreement.},

	Dendrochronology can provide new data about past avalanches and their

	with this purpose. The Aludex project aims to obtain information
	about the frequency and extent of extreme avalanches, using a dendrochronological
	and a nivo-meteorological approach. In this paper, we present the
	results of a dendrochronological study of the Canal del Roe Roig
	avalanche path which was affected by two extreme avalanches in February
	1996. This first dendrochronological study has permitted us to assess
	the tree-ring signals due to avalanche events in 53 out of 132 dated
	trees. The trees presented a variety of responses to the 1996 avalanche
	events. It is shown that the type of tree-ring signal depends on
	tree age. The methodology has proved successful in detecting the
	1996 and 1972 documented avalanche events, and provided outstanding
	evidence of undocumented past events such as one in 1930.},

	and others (1993, 1994) approaches are based on fluid-mechanics conservation
	laws where the snow is transported and diffused by the air flow.
	These models consider the saltation laver as a boundary condition.
	For the flow, and for the suspension, we adopt the same model as
	that of Uematsu and Listen. For mass exchange between the flow and
	snow surface, we have developed an erosion-deposition model where
	mass exchange is defined in relation to flow turbulence, threshold-friction
	velocity and snow concentration. Our snow-erosion model was calibrated
	using Takeuchi's (1980) field measurements. The deposition model
	was tested by comparing numerical results with wind-tunnel ones,
	for sawdust-accumulation windward and leeward of a solid snow fence
	with a bottom gap. The numerical results obtained are close to the
	experimental results. The main results of the various sensitivity
	experiments are: the leeward accumulation is very sensitive to the
	ratio (mu*/mu*(t))(it appears for (mu*/mu,(t)) close to 1 and disappears
	for (mu*/mu*(t)) > 1.2), the global accumulation produced by the
	fence increases as (mu*/mu*(t)) decreases and the back reaction of
	particles on turbulence extends slightly the windward accumulation.},

	Alps. In the first experiment, we compared the storage capacity of
	several different kinds of living fences consisting of pruned spruces,
	unpruned spruces and sorbs. Field observations during the winter
	of 1995-96 proved that deciduous trees such as sorbs are effective,
	and that pruning the lower 50 cm is not effective at the end of the
	season because of the weight of snow on low branches. However, the
	use of natural plant barriers has disadvantages: a living snow fence
	takes time to reach an effective height and is difficult to establish
	on windy sites at a high altitude. This is a real problem. Therefore,
	in a second experiment, we studied the death rate of larches planted
	behind a fence. Mie noticed that the snow fence had several effects,
	snow accumulation (until the planted trees grew up) and protection
	of the planted trees.},

	drift-area changes behind a small-scale snow fence as a function
	of time for different fetches but for the same mean wind speed at
	the beginning of the testing section. For each fetch, we carried
	out vertical profiles of sand particles using image processing and
	we studied the geometrical parameters of the drift. We conclude that
	changes in the cross-section drift area depend on the ablation length
	and if particle saturation is not reached, the use of a storm-duration

	we point out that drift pattern vary as a function of the concentration

  pages = {373--378},
  abstract = {Passive protection structures reduce avalanche run-out distance and
	hence the potential damages brought about by an avalanche, by reducing
	its velocity and mass. This paper starts with a summary of the main
	existing results on interactions between snow avalanches and dams.
	In the case of dense avalanches, the effects of dams are re-examined
	and previous results are theoretically justified. For a powder-snow
	avalanche a dam has two primary effects. The momentum is reduced
	by the retarding force upstream of the dam and when the jet collides
	with the ground after the dam. Entrainment of air during the jet
	reduces its velocity since the mass increases. For a dense avalanche,
	there is a retarding force upstream of the dam and when the jet collides
	with the ground, but there is no significant effect of air entrainment.
	There is, however, deposition of snow which reduces the momentum
	of the avalanche without affecting the velocity. The reduction of
	the volume due to deposition reduces the spreading length and therefore
	the run-out distance of the avalanche. Downstream of the obstacle,
	the avalanche flow is regarded as an airborne jet. A comparative
	study shows that density and ambient-fluid entrainment effects are
	significant for gravity currents, powder and dense snow avalanches
	whereas they are negligible in granular flows.},

  abstract = {The time evolution of drifting snow under a steady wind is estimated
	using a new numerical model of drifting snow. In the model, Lagrangian
	stochastic theory is used to incorporate the effect of turbulence
	on the motion of drifting-snow particles. This method enables us
	to discuss both the saltation and the suspension process. Aerodynamic
	entrainment, grain/bed collision (splash process), wind modification
	and particle size distribution are also taken into account. The calculations
	show that the time needed by the total mass flux to reach a steady
	state appears to be 3-5 s. Vertical profiles of horizontal mass flux
	near the surface show a similar tendency. In contrast, it takes >
	50 s for the wind speed and the whole mass-flux profile to reach
	a steady state. This longer time depends on the time-scale of the
	turbulent diffusion, which is responsible for the mass flux extending
	to an order of a few meters in height. Applying Taylor's hypothesis,
	the estimated length scale at which drifting snow reaches equilibrium
	is around 400 m. This result is comparable with previously reported
	field observations.},

	of saltating snow particles with varying friction velocity. Trajectories
	of saltating particles were recorded by a video system with a laser
	sheet and trajectory statistics, such as ejection and impact velocities
	and angles, were obtained for each particle. Parabolic trajectories
	are considerably elongated with an increase in the friction velocity;
	impact angle was approximately the same but ejection angle decreased
	with increasing friction velocity. Furthermore, it should be noted
	that the gradient of flux decay with height decreased with friction
	velocity In the experiments, a snow-particle counter, which can sense
	not only the number of particles but also their diameters, was introduced.
	The flux distribution and the transport rate obtained as a function
	of the particle size gave a new insight into the relationship with
	the friction velocity. Trajectories of saltating grains were computed,
	using the measurements of the initial ejection velocities, angles
	and the mean velocity profile of the air. The results agreed reasonably
	with our measurements. Using the measured probability distribution
	of the ejection velocities, an ensemble of trajectories was computed
	and thence the vertical profiles of stream-wise fluxes. The exponential
	decay of the flux on height was obtained ill all cases and it supports
	the basic validity of the model, although agreement is less than
	expected.},

  abstract = {It has been postulated that heavy summer snowfalls have a large impact
	on the mass balance of mid-latitude glaciers, because they simultaneously
	add mass to the glacier and reduce the amount of absorbed solar radiation.
	An automatic weather station (AWS) on the snout of Morteratschglctscher,
	Switzerland, registered a large summer snowfall event on 10-11 July
	2000. Sonic rangers recorded about 20 cm of new snow on the snout
	and about 50 cm near the equilibrium line. We have used data from
	the AWS to study the impact on the melt process. The data show that
	in the ablation zone of the glacier the snow has melted and the effect
	on the albedo has disappeared after about 5 days. The suppression
	of the melt by the high albedo of the fresh snow is an important
	effect. For the ablation zone we find a feedback factor of about
	four, that is, the total effect of the snowfall event on the annual
	specific balance is about four times the amount of mass added during
	the event. We have also used a mass-balance model with 25 in spatial
	resolution to assess the impact of the snowfall on the net balance
	of the entire glacier. NVe find the strongest effects just below
	the equilibrium line. Averaged over the glacier, the amount of snow
	deposited was 224 mm w. e. The calculated effect on the total mass
	balance of the glacier is 354mmw.e.},

	particles and cavities due to internal melting beneath the sun-crust
	layer. The surface-cooling rate was between -50 and -100 W m(-2)
	, and the absorption of shortwave radiation exceeded 200 W m(-2).
	The energy balance during the formation of the sun crust is consistent
	with the data observed in Nature. The sources of H2O for the sun-crust
	formation were investigated through changes in delta(18)O. Taking
	into account that the delta value of sun crust was larger than that
	of the snow beneath it and the calculations of the latent-heat emission
	with the sun-crust formation, it was concluded that the retention
	of meltwater by capillary force and refreezing in a chin layer was
	the dominant mechanism of this metamorphism.},

	the formation of an ice la)rer when refreezing progresses faster

	properties of a snowpack. The texture index (TI) is a new concept
	to quantify the texture of snow at the micro- and mesoscale, a scale
	at which the properties of snow layers are responsible for the stability
	of a snowpack. It is calculated by taking the ratio of mean grain-size
	(mm) of snow to density (kg m(-3)) of snow in a given layer. It combines
	a microstructural with a mesostructural parameter. An empirically
	derived TI is compared with a simulated TI for laboratory experimental
	snow and natural snow profiles. The TI was calculated throughout
	the development of three temperature-gradient snow experiments from
	laboratory measurements of grain-size and density. In a one-dimensional
	finite-element snowpack model (SNOWPACK), the development of the
	mean grain-size and density of these snow samples was simulated.
	It can be shown that the measured TI can be predicted by the modelled
	TI. Furthermore, three natural snow profiles from the Weissfluhjoch
	(Switzerland) test-field are compared with their simulations in terms
	of TI. This comparison reveals shortcomings in the measurement of
	fundamental parameters. It also shows the dependency of a good physical
	model on quantitative process descriptions at the microscale. The
	TI can be estimated using the force signal of the SnowMicroPen, a
	new high-resolution snow micropenetrometer. It is suggested that
	more accurate classical measurements combined with penetrometer measurements
	in the immediate vicinity of the snow profile will allow better verification
	of SNOWPACK simulations.},

  abstract = {The new approaches in absorption X-ray microtomography allow snow-volume
	image acquisition in the cm 3 range without destroying snow structure,
	and make it possible to perform micromechanical studies with the
	real geometry. The main objective of this paper is to introduce the
	development of a new three-dimensional (3-D) geometry modeling and
	finite-element analysis simulation package adapted to these scales.
	These new code modules and procedures are briefly described using
	an isothermal metamorphism snow experiment (-2 degrees C, 3 months).
	This sample of aged snow (3.375 mm(3); 300(3) voxels) allows simulation
	of a simple hypothetical uniaxial compressive stress experiment.
	The constitutive equations, boundary conditions, basic assumptions
	and the result showing the stress field over the 3-D data are discussed.
	The first qualitative results show a maximum stress of 6-9 MPa in
	some small bonds, showing the potential of these codes to simulate
	the micromechanical behavior of complex materials.},

  abstract = {Spatial statistics of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt rate were
	measured using spatially distributed, sequential ground surveys of
	depth and density in forested, shrub and alpine tundra environments
	over several seasons within a 185 km(2) mountain catchment in Yukon
	Territory, Canada. When stratified by slope/aspect sub-units within
	landscape classes, SWE frequency distributions matched the log-normal,
	but multiclass surveys showed a more bimodal distribution. Within-class
	variability of winter SWE could be grouped into (i) windswept tundra
	and (ii) sheltered tundra/forest regimes. During melt, there was
	little association between the standard deviation and mean of SWE.
	At small scales, a negative correlation developed between spatial
	distributions of pre-melt SWE and melt rate where shrubs were exposed
	above the snow. This was not evident in dense-forest, alpine-tundra
	or deep-snowdrift landscape classes. At medium scales, adja-negative
	SWE and melt-rate correlations were also found between mean values
	from adjacent slope sub-units of the tundra landscape class. The
	medium-scale correlation was likely due to slope effects on insolation
	and blowing-snow redistribution. At the catchment scale, the correlation
	between mean SWE and melt rate from various landscape classes reversed
	to a positive one, likely influenced by intercepted and blowing regimes,
	shrub exposure during melt and adiabatic cooling with elevation rise.
	Covariance at the catchment scale resulted in a 40\% acceleration
	of snow depletion. These results suggest that the spatial variability
	and covariability of both SWE and melt rate are scale- and landscape-class-specific
	and need to be considered in a landscape-stratified manner at the
	appropriate scale when snow depletion is described and the snowmelt
	duration predicted.},

	of cohesionless shallow granular material down an inclined plane
	was proposed by Savage and Hutter (SH) in 1989. This model consists
	of depth-averaged equations for the time and space evolution of the
	velocity profile and the avalanche depth. Their model was generalized
	to incorporate more complicated topography in which the coordinate

	were bigger, snow was warmer and denser, and the fraction of faceted
	snow decreased while the fraction of icy or melting snow increased,

	and spreads over the entire territory before early January. Snowmelt
	begins in mid January in the southern regions and then snow cover
	retreats rapidly northward until it disappears completely before
	late June. Northward of 60 degrees N, the land surface is snow-covered
	for more than half the year. The longest snow-cover duration is observed
	on the central Siberian plateau (about 9.5 months) and along the
	Arctic coastal regions (about 8.5 months). One of the most conspicuous
	features of the snow coverage in the FSU is that the length of the
	snow-accumulation period differ considerably from region to region
	(2-7 months), while the length of the snowmelt period is rather short
	and uniform over almost the entire territory (1-2 months). Although
	the maximum snow depths are 20-50 cm in most regions of the FSU,
	they exceed 80 cm in the mountainous regions in central Siberia,

	calculating correlation coefficients between the snowfall intensities

	deep snow along the Yenisei river valley is caused by frequent migration

	run at the University of British Columbia, Canada, and a local numerical
	avalanche-forecasting model developed for Kootenay Pass (McClung

	extend the lead time of avalanche forecasts by using NWP forecasts
	of meteorological variables as input to statistical avalanche-threat
	models (instead of the traditional method of using current/past observed
	meteorological variables as input); and (2) to create another tool
	to help avalanche forecasters in their daily decision-making by making
	true forecasts instead of "nowcasts" Therefore, verified weather-forecast
	model output was used as input for the local avalanche-forecasting
	model at Kootenay Pass. The resulting 24 hour avalanche forecast
	was compared to observed avalanche occurrences and to the 12 hour
	avalanche forecast with current weather observations. As a result,
	the avalanche-model output for the test runs with numerically predicted
	weather data is comparable in accuracy to the runs with observed
	weather data. The results also suggest that avalanches may be predicted
	statistically for 24 hours into the future when high-resolution NWP
	is used as input, weather- and avalanche-forecast errors taken into

  abstract = {Dry snow avalanches consist of two distinct layers. A dense-flow layer
	is superposed by a powder-snow layer, a cloud of relatively small
	ice particles suspended in air. The density of this suspension is
	one order of magnitude smaller than that of the dense flow. A simulation
	model for dry avalanches has been developed, based on separate sub-models
	for the two layers. The sub-models are coupled by an additional transition
	model, describing the exchange of mass and momentum between the layers.
	The fundamentals of the two-dimensional granular flow model for the
	dense flow and of the three-dimensional turbulent mixture model for
	the powder flow are presented. Results of the complete coupled model,
	SAMOS (Snow Avalanche MOdelling and Simulation), applied to observed
	catastrophic avalanche events, are discussed, and the prediction
	of powder-snow pressures acting on a tunnel bridge is briefly described.
	SAMOS is used routinely for hazard zoning at the Austrian Federal

	the ejection factor, which expresses the degree of erosion due to
	drifting snow, were obtained as functions of friction velocity by
	means of wind-tunnel experiments for semi-hard snow cover. The saturated-snowdrift
	transport rate was also obtained experimentally as a function of
	friction velocity. Based on these characteristics and the parameter,
	the development of the saltation layer of drifting snow along the
	fetch was simulated under various conditions such as snow hardness,
	wind speed and snowfall intensity. The main results are as follows.
	The developing distance denoting the distance required for the saltation
	layer to attain saturation, X-sat is determined by saltation length,
	ejection factor and saturated-snowdrift transport rate, all of which
	depend on wind speed. It is also affected by the magnitude of snowdrift
	transport rate at the starting point and by the intensity of snowfall
	if it exists. The dependence Of X-sat on wind speed is not simple
	in the case of semi-hard snow cover: X-sat increases with wind speed
	under weak to moderate wind conditions and then decreases under moderate
	to strong wind conditions. It is sensitive to snow hardness: it is
	about one order longer on hard snow cover than on semi-hard snow
	cover. Snowfall reduces not only the value of X-sat but also its
	dependence on snow hardness.},

	parameters in the theoretical expression, saltation height h(0) and
	mass flux at the surface q(0), were determined. The main results
	are as follows: (1) In the case of hard snow cover, snow particles
	are hardly ejected and drifting snow is maintained by the seeded
	snows The value of h(0) linearly increases with wind speed and decreases
	with snow temperature, and q(0) decreases with wind speed and is
	in proportion to seeding rate. (2) In the case of loose snow cover,
	erosion occurs under high-wind conditions and the contribution of
	the ejected snow particles to drifting snow is remarkable. The ho
	linearly increases with wind speed, but its value is smaller than
	the value over hard snow cover. Due to erosion, q(0) increases with
	wind speed. Snowdrift transport rate and q(0) do not change with
	seeding rate under low-wind conditions, because the drifting snow
	is saturated. Under high-wind conditions, however, both snowdrift
	transport rate and go slightly increase with seeding rate.},

	the release and movement of a slush torrent was documented on video
	and in photographs. Meteorological and snow-hydrological measurements
	carried out during these campaigns were analysed with respect to
	slushflow initiation due to snowmelt. Since slushflow are quite common
	in polar and sub-polar drainage basins (although they are not restricted
	to these regions), specific atmospheric and hydrological boundary
	conditions must be fulfilled for slushflow initiation due to snowmelt.
	Radiative fluxes, air temperatures and wind velocities are the most
	important atmospheric variables, while snow depth, depth of the water-saturated
	layer, hydraulic conductivity and snow structure are the primary
	snow variables of interest. It has been shown that slushflows can
	be released due to energy input in the snow cover by net radiation
	and sensible heat within the ordinary range of the high-latitudinal
	snowmelt period. Slush torrent initiation is intensified by a superposition
	of both energy fluxes. Infiltration losses were not significant even
	when permafrost was not present. Crucial for slushflow initiation
	due to snowmelt is the timing of energy input and meltwater flow
	through the snowpack.},

	We developed sensors suitable for continuous and non-continuous measurements

	sensors have been constructed. Their small size and high surface
	area to weight ratio minimizes their movement in the snowpack, except
	when they are exposed to intense solar radiation. Results show that
	changes in dry-snow density of less than 5 kg m(-3) can be detected.
	Infiltration of even small amounts of water clearly shows up in the

	can be used to accomplish the determination of avalanche velocity
	and runout distance, the paper deals with the participation of the

	strain and toughness decrease with decreasing temperature. Failure
	stress was found to increase slightly with decreasing temperature.
	The effect is not very distinct but close to statistically significant

  abstract = {In recent years, most avalanche fatalities have been due to dry-snow

	activities, at least in countries where recreational skiing takes
	place, as in Western Europe and North America. Simple analysis suggests,
	and previous measurements have shown, that the skier's dynamic impact
	is relevant for triggering, decreasing with increasing depth within
	the snow cover er and depending on the layering of the snow cover.
	The stress distribution below a skier in the snow cover is not known,
	but is important in view of the critical area required for fracture
	propagation preceding dry-snow slab avalanche release. The skier's
	zone of influence was measured with load cells buried within the
	snow cover in a level study plot for different depths. The size of
	the area of influence is of the order of a few 0.1m(2), but also
	depends on the weak-layer strength. Stresses in the snow cover below
	skiers who walk behind each other are not cumulative. The effect
	on the influence size is in accordance with the independent estimate
	for the critical size (0.1-1 m) for fracture propagation in the case
	of rapid loading. It supports the hypothesis that skiers induce a
	brittle fracture within the weak layer or at a weak interface between
	layers, leading under certain conditions to slab release, without
	necessarily hitting a pre-existing flaw.},

  abstract = {The release of a dry-snow slab avalanche involves brittle fracture.
	It is therefore essentially a non-linear fracture mechanics problem.
	Traditional snow-stability evaluation has mainly focused on snow
	strength measurements. Fracture toughness describes how well a material
	can withstand failure. The fracture toughness of snow is therefore
	a key parameter to assess fracture propagation propensity, and hence
	snow slope stability. Fracture toughness in tension K-Ic and shear
	K-IIc, was determined with notched cantilever-beam experiments in
	a cold laboratory. Measurements were performed at 3 different temperatures
	and with different snow types of density rho = 100-300 kg incorresponding
	to typical dry-snow slab properties. The fracture toughness in tension
	K-Ic was found to be larger (by about a factor of 1.4) than in shear
	K-IIc. Typical values of the fracture toughness were 500-1000 Pa
	m(1/2) for the snow types tested. This suggests that snow is one
	of the most brittle materials known to man. A power-law relation
	of toughness K-Ic on relative density was found with an exponent
	of about 2. The fracture toughness in tension K-Ic decreased with
	increasing temperature following an Arrhenius relation below about
	-8 degrees C with an apparent activation energy of about 0.16 eV.
	Above -6 degrees C the fracture toughness increased with increasing
	temperature towards the melting point, i.e. the Atrhenius relation
	broke down. The key property in dry-snow slab avalanche release,
	the critical crack size under shear at failure, was estimated to
	be about 1 m.},

	variable, both skewed distributions, typical of alpine areas, and
	more normal distributions, typical of forested areas, can be accounted
	for. A particular problem is to represent fractional snow-covered

	a response to a melting event is explicitly linked to the shape of
	the distribution of SWE and is estimated as the probability of non-exceedance
	of the melted amount from a scaled version of the spatial distribution
	of SAVE. An extensive snow-measuring programme, where several snow
	courses have been measured repeatedly throughout the melting season,
	justifies the dynamical aspects of the snow distribution in the modelling
	approach. The modelling, approach has been tested with the Swedish

	avalanche dynamics calculations contain a questionable simplification:
	they assume that avalanche mass is constant Ã¯?`Â½ meaning that no
	snow cover entrainment or mass deposition takes place along the avalanche
	path. This assumption is in clear contradiction to post-event observations
	which show that much of the snow cover has been eroded and that deposits
	are left along the avalanche track. The aim of this work is to investigate
	the influence of snow entrainment on avalanche dynamics calculations.
	A simple GrigorianÃ¯?`Â½Ostroumov type entrainment model, which assumes
	entrainment localized in an area close to the avalanche front, is
	introduced into a depth-averaged numerical model containing different
	constitutive flow laws. The snow cover distribution along the avalanche
	path must be specified. The results of the numerical simulation with
	entrainment are compared to existing Swiss calculation procedures.
	Six well-documented extreme avalanche events are used for this purpose.
	We find that inclusion of a simple entrainment model leads to: (1)
	a better prediction of runout distances, (2) a more accurate determination
	of flow and deposition depths and (3) a better control over model
	parameters; that is, the parameter range needed to calculate small
	and large-sized avalanche events narrows. However, one-dimensional
	models, as presented here, are limited because the flow width and

	situations by the user. This can introduce additional uncertainties

	avalanche track which is representative for the Dolomites, northern
	Italy. It monitors avalanche pressures, speed, flow height and variations
	of the avalanche shape and extent. In winter 1997/98, together with
	the standard measurements, a series of new field measurements and
	observations of the snow cover on the avalanche path were conducted
	for the first time in order to accurately determine the avalanche
	mass balance. The information collected is typical for dense flow
	avalanches which have small dimension and develop mainly along a
	channelled path. In winter 1997/98, four events were studied. For
	each event, in several sections front the starting zone to the deposition
	zone, manual measurements were carried out in order to investigate
	mass entrainment and deposition processes. The mass evolution of
	the avalanche has been determined. It is shown that the avalanche
	mass increases by up to 720\% with respect to the initial release
	mass. This entrainment process is related to the speed reached by
	the avalanche front. In addition, it has been determined that during
	the acceleration phase of the avalanche front the underlying snow
	cover is mostly eroded and there is no deposition of snow. In the
	deceleration phase, by contrast, erosion decreases progressively,
	reaching the value zero, while deposition becomes progressively larger.
	These results underscore the importance of the mass balance as a
	fundamental component in avalanche-dynamics research.},

	km(2) Swiss pre-Alpine catchment. Snow-depth data were analyzed with

	At larger scales (10(3)-10(5) M), local (order 100 m) forcing continues
	to produce most of the layer heterogeneity, with synoptic-scale variations
	adding small amounts. Cross-correlation at these larger scales is

  abstract = {In a recent paper (Sturm and others, 1995), a global seasonal snow-cover
	classification system was developed with each class defined by snow
	properties like grain size and type. Here, characteristic bulk density
	vs time curves are assigned to three classes using snow-course data
	from Alaskan and Canadian sites. Within each class, curves have similar
	slopes and intercepts but between classes they are different. The
	relationship between slope, intercept and snow rheology has been
	investigated using a finite-difference model in which snow layers
	are assumed to behave as viscous fluids. Using observed slopes, the
	density-dependent compactive viscosity of each class has been determined.
	These are consistent with published values. Results indicate that
	load and load history are less important to the compaction behavior
	than grain and bond characteristics, snow temperature and wetness.
	The study suggests that differences in compaction behavior arise
	primarily from differences in rheology, the result of climatically
	controlled differences in the character of the snow This finding
	explains why regional snow densities have been successfully predicted
	from air temperature and wind speed alone, without considering snow
	depth.},

  abstract = {During winter 1999 three large avalanche events were triggered by
	explosives at SLF's avalanche test site, Vallee de la Sionne, canton
	Valais, Switzerland. One important goal of these large-scale field
	experiments was to measure the release and deposition volumes of
	avalanches by photogrammetric methods. In this paper, the photogrammetric
	measurements of all three avalanches are summarized. For one avalanche
	event it was possible to realize the whole measuring procedure as
	planned, and to obtain volume measurements before and after the avalanche
	triggering. In the other two avalanche events, the photographs before
	the triggering of the avalanche failed. Nevertheless the photographs
	taken after the avalanches provide valuable information on the fracture
	depth at the fracture line. The mean fracture depth of the largest
	avalanche was about 2.10 m, varying between 1 and 3.5 m over a width
	of > 1000 m. The total volume of the deposition of all three avalanche
	events was about 1300 000 m(3). The deposits are distributed over
	a length of > 1000 m with depths up to 30 m. The difference between
	the released and deposited volumes proved that avalanches entrain
	a large amount of snow along the avalanche track. Furthermore, the
	snow distribution in the deposition zone provides important information
	about the behaviour of a dense flowing avalanche in the runout zone.},

	of the energy balance at the snow surface, mainly that regarding

	metamorphosis of compacted particles into melt forms was slower than
	the change shown by the measurements, and faceted snow particles,

	numerous marked echoes in a noise-free radargram. The depths of these
	echoes coincided roughly with those of large density contrasts observed
	in the snow pit. Thus, we argue that the echoes correspond to thin
	ice layers. Furthermore, the minimum density contrasts detected by

  abstract = {A theoretical model is formulated to investigate the influence of
	random variations in strength of the weak layer on slab avalanche
	release. An equation for slab stability is derived which accounts
	for stress redistribution between strong and weak regions. The model
	is first used to re-derive results on shear fractures (shear bands)
	in a homogeneous slab. It is then applied to the case of a slab with
	randomly varying peak strength of the weak layer. It is demonstrated
	that such variation may have a dramatic knock-down effect on the
	failure strength of a slope. The nature of the critical flaw is studied
	and precursors to failure are investigated.},

  title = {A nearest-neighbour model for forecasting skier-triggered dry-slab
	avalanches on persistent weak layers in the Columbia Mountains, Canada},
  journal = {Annals of Glaciology, Vol 38 2004},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {166--172},
  abstract = {Nearest-neighbour models for avalanche forecasting have made little
	use of snowpack properties; however, slab thickness (H), slab load
	(Load) and a skier stability index (Sk38) have proven useful for
	regional avalanche forecasting in the Columbia Mountains, western
	Canada. This study explores 21 meteorological, snowpack and elaborated
	variables including Sk38., H and Load. A daily, skier instability
	index (DSI) is developed as a response variable using skier-triggered
	avalanche activity on persistent weak layers and stability ratings
	at the end of the day. In rank correlation analysis, Sk38, Load,
	previous avalanche activity, H and some meteorological variables
	were highly ranked. The physical explanations are discussed. In classification-tree
	analysis, Sk38 was ranked as the most important variable and used
	in the development of the tree structure along with Load. Besides
	Sk38 and Load, snowpack thickness, the number of previously triggered
	avalanches and H have potential to predict DSI. Further we included
	once all 21 variables, and once all variables except Sk38, H and
	Load in nearest-neighbour models. Comparing the performance of these
	models shows that Sk38 along with Load and H have high potential
	to forecast the DSI on a regional scale.},
