#++++++++++++++++ particle Initialisation +++++++++
# particle initialisation step - set iniStep to True to activate redistribution of particles to reduce SPH force
# this is in a development stage - hence parameters are set for development and will be adjusted after extensive testing
iniStep = True
# max number of iterations - high number might cause significant increase in computational time

#+++++++++SNOW properties
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - relTh read from ini file

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# SPH gradient option
# 0) No pressure gradients computed
# 1) SamosAT style (no reprojecion on the surface, dz = 0 and gz is used)
# 2) SamosAT done in the cartesian coord system (reprojecion on the surface, dz != 0 and g3 is used)
# 3) SamosAT but done in the local coord system (will hopefully allow us to add the earth pressure coef)
# and this time reprojecion on the surface, dz not 0 and g3 is used
