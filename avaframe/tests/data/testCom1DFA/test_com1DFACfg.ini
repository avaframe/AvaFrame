### Config File - This file contains the main settings for the simulation run
## Copy to  local_com1DFACfg.ini and set you parameters

[GENERAL]
#++++++++++++++++ Simulation type
# list of simulations that shall be performed (null, ent, res, entres, available (use all available input data))
simTypeList = entres
# model type - only for file naming (dfa - dense flow avalanche)
modelType = dfa

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pft, pfv, FT, FV, P, particles) - separated by |
resType = ppr|pft|pfv|particles
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0:10

#+++++Release thickness++++
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - relTh read from ini file
relThFromShp = False
# release thickness (only considered if relThFromShp=False)
relTh = 1.
#+++++Secondary release thickness+++++
# if secRelArea is True - add secondary release area
secRelArea = True
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - secondaryRelTh read from ini file
secondaryRelThFromShp = False
#  if a variation on secondaryRelTh shall be performed add here +- percent and number of steps separated by $
# for example secondaryRelThPercentVariation=50$10
secondaryRelThPercentVariation =
# secondary area release thickness (only considered if secondaryRelThFromShp=False)
secondaryRelTh = 0.5
#+++++Entrainment thickness++++
# True if entrainment thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - entTh read from ini file
entThFromShp = False
# if a variation on entTh shall be performed add here +- percent and number of steps separated by $
# for example entThPercentVariation=50$10
entThPercentVariation =
# entrainment thickness (only considered if entThFromShp=False)
entTh = 0.3


#++++++++++++Time stepping parameters
# fixed time step [s] (also used as first time step when using CFL)
dt = 0.1|0.2
# End time [s]
tEnd = 50
