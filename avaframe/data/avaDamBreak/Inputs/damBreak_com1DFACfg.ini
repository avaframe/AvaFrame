[GENERAL]
#++++++++++++++++ Simulation type
# list of simulations that shall be performed (null, ent, res, entres, available (use all available input data))
simTypeList = null

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pfd, pfv, FD, FV, P, particles) - separated by |
resType = FT|FV|Vx|Vy|Vz
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0:1

#++++++++++++++++ particle Initialisation +++++++++
# particle initialisation step - set iniStep to True to activate redistribution of particles to reduce SPH force
# this is in a development stage - hence parameters are set for development and will be adjusted after extensive testing
iniStep = True
# max number of iterations - high number might cause significant increase in computational time
maxIterations = 30
# buffer zone factor multiplied with sphKernelRadius
bufferZoneFactor = 4
fdOptionIni = False

#+++++++++SNOW properties
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - relTh read from ini file
relThFromShp = False

#++++++++++++Time stepping parameters
tEnd = 5
# to use a variable time step (time step depends on kernel radius)
sphKernelRadiusTimeStepping = True
# courant number if option cflTimeStepping is chosen.
# Upper time step limit coefficient if option sphKernelRadiusTimeStepping is chosen.
cMax = 0.01

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# SPH gradient option
# 0) No pressure gradients computed
# 1) SamosAT style (no reprojecion on the surface, dz = 0 and gz is used)
# 2) SamosAT done in the cartesian coord system (reprojecion on the surface, dz != 0 and g3 is used)
# 3) SamosAT but done in the local coord system (will hopefully allow us to add the earth pressure coef)
# and this time reprojecion on the surface, dz not 0 and g3 is used
sphOption = 2
# Choice of artificial viscosity
# 0) No artificial viscosity
# 1) SAMOS artificial viscosity
# 2) Ata artificial viscosity
viscOption = 0

#++++++++++++++++ Particles
# number of particles defined by: MPPDIR= mass per particle direct, MPPDH= mass per particles through release thickness,
# MPPKR= mass per particles through number of particles per kernel radius
massPerParticleDeterminationMethod = MPPKR
# is computed with: nPPK = nPPK0 * (sphKR/sphKR0)^aPPK
# where sphKR is the sphKernelRadius specified further up
# reference kernel radius
sphKR0 = 5
# reference number of particles per kernel radius
nPPK0 = 10|20|30
# variation of nppK exponent
aPPK = -0.5|-1|-1.5|-2

# if splitOption=0
# threshold for splitting particles, split if: mPart > massPerPart x thresholdMassSplit
thresholdMassSplit = 10


# remesh the input DEM
# expected mesh size [m]
meshCellSize = 3
# sph kernel smoothing length [m]
sphKernelRadius = 3

#++++++++++++Friction model
# add the friction using an explicit formulation (1)
# 0 use an implicit method
explicitFriction = 1
# friction type (samosAT, Coulomb)
frictModel = Coulomb
