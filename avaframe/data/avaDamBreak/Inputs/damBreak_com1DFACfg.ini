#++++++++++++++++ Simulation type
# list of simulations that shall be performed (null, ent, res, entres, available (use all available input data))
simTypeList = null

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pfd, pfv, FD, FV, P, particles) - separated by |
resType = FD|FV|Vx|Vy|Vz|particles
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0:0.1

#+++++++++SNOW properties
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - relTh read from ini file

#++++++++++++Time stepping parameters
# fixed time step [s] (also used as first time step when using CFL)

# End time [s]
tEnd = 2
# only one of the two following options can be activated
# to use a variable time step (defined by the CFL number)
cflTimeStepping = False
# to use a variable time step (time step depends on kernel radius)
sphKernelRadiusTimeStepping = True
# courant number if option cflTimeStepping is chosen.
# Upper time step limit coefficient if option sphKernelRadiusTimeStepping is chosen.

# to constrain the lower margin of the allowed time step
constrainCFL = False

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# SPH gradient option
# 0) No pressure gradients computed
# 1) SamosAT style (no reprojecion on the surface, dz = 0 and gz is used)
# 2) SamosAT done in the cartesian coord system (reprojecion on the surface, dz != 0 and g3 is used)
# 3) SamosAT but done in the local coord system (will hopefully allow us to add the earth pressure coef)
# and this time reprojecion on the surface, dz not 0 and g3 is used

# 0) No artificial viscosity
# 1) SAMOS artificial viscosity
# 2) Ata artificial viscosity

#++++++++++++++++ Particles
# number of particles defined by: MPPDIR= mass per particle direct, MPPDH= mass per particles through release thickness,
# MPPKR= mass per particles through number of particles per kernel radius

# is computed with: nPPK = nPPK0 * (sphKR/sphKR0)^aPPK

# reference kernel radius

# reference number of particles per kernel radius
nPPK0 = 20
# variation of nppK exponent

# splitting option
# either split particles based on mass (splitOption = 0)
# or split/merge in order to keep a constant number of particles per kernel radius(splitOption = 1)
