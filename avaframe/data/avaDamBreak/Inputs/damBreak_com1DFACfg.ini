resType = FD|FV|particles
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# SPH gradient option
# 0) No pressure gradients computed
# 1) SamosAT style (no reprojecion on the surface, dz = 0 and dz is used)
# 2) SamostAt but done in the local coord system (will hopefully allow us to add the earth pressure coef)
# and this time reprojecion on the surface, dz not 0 and g3 is used
# 3) same as 2) but correcting the gradient to get constant exact gradients
# 4) same as 2) but correcting the gradient to get linear exact gradients
