[GENERAL]
#++++++++++++++++ Simulation type
# list of simulations that shall be performed (null, ent, res, entres, available (use all available input data))
simTypeList = null

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pfd, pfv, FD, FV, P, particles) - separated by |
resType = FD|FV|pfv
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0|5

#++++++++++++Time stepping parameters
# fixed time step [s]
dt = 0.01
# End time [s]
tEnd = 6
# to use a variable time step (defined by the CFL number)
cflTimeStepping = False
# courant number
cMax = 0.25
# to constrain the lower margin of the allowed time step
constrainCFL = False
# max time step in case of small velocities
maxdT = 0.05
# min time step in case of high velocity
mindT = 0.001
# stopCriterion (based on massFlowing or kinEnergy)
stopCritType = kinEnergy
# if based on massFlowing, specify the velocity threshold for flowing mass (m/s)
uFlowingThreshold = 0.01
# stopCriterion (stops when massFlowing<0.01*peakMassFlowing or ke<0.01*pke)
stopCrit = 0.01

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# number of particles defined by: MPPDIR= mass per particle direct, MPPDH= mass per particles through release thickness
massPerParticleDeterminationMethod = MPPDIR
# mass per particle [kg]
massPerPart = 150

#++++++++++++Friction model
# friction type (samosAT, Coulomb)
frictModel = Coulomb
#+++++++++++++SamosAt friction model
