#++++++++++++++++ Simulation type
# list of simulations that shall be performed (null, ent, res, entres, available (use all available input data))
simTypeList = null

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pfd, pfv, FD, FV, P, particles) - separated by |
resType = FD|FV|pfv
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0|5

# Release thickness settings

# End time [s]
