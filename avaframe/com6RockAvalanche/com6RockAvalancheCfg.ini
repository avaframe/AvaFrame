[GENERAL]


[com1DFA_override]

#+++++++++++++ Output++++++++++++
# desired result Parameters (ppr, pft, pfv, pta, FT, FV, P, FM, Vx, Vy, Vz, TA, particles) - separated by |
resType = pft|pfv|FT|particles
# saving time step, i.e.  time in seconds (first and last time step are always saved)
# option 1: give an interval with start:interval in seconds (tStep = 0:5 - this will save desired results every 5 seconds for the full simulation)
# option 2: explicitly list all desired time steps (closest to actual computational time step) separated by | (example tSteps = 1|50.2|100)
# NOTE: initial and last time step are always saved!
tSteps = 0:025

#+++++++++SNOW properties
# density of snow [kg/mÂ³]
rho = 2500

#+++++Release thickness++++
# True if release thickness should be read from shapefile file; if False - relTh read from ini file
relThFromShp = False
# read release thickness directly from file (relThFromShp needs to be False)
relThFromFile = True

#+++++++++++++SPH parameters
# SPH gradient option
# 0) No pressure gradients computed
# 1) SamosAT style (no reprojecion on the surface, dz = 0 and gz is used)
# 2) SamosAT done in the cartesian coord system (reprojecion on the surface, dz != 0 and g3 is used)
# 3) SamosAT but done in the local coord system (will hopefully allow us to add the earth pressure coef)
# and this time reprojecion on the surface, dz not 0 and g3 is used
sphOption = 3

#++++++++++++++++ Particles
# mass per particle [kg] (if MPPDIR is used)
massPerPart = 282300.
# release thickness per particle (if MPPDH is used)
deltaTh = 1.05
# splitting option
# either split particles based on mass (splitOption = 0)
# or split/merge in order to keep a constant number of particles per kernel radius(splitOption = 1)
splitOption = 1

#++++++++++++Friction model
# Please note that each type has their own/separate parameters!
frictModel = Voellmy
#+++++++++++++Voellmy friction model
muvoellmy = 0.035
xsivoellmy = 700.

# which result parameters shall be included as plots in report,  - separated by |
plotFields = pfv|pft|FT
