### Config File - This file contains the main settings for the range time diagram in distanceTimeAnalysis
## Copy to  local_distanceTimeAnalysisCfg.ini and set you parameters

# result type used for creating range time diagram e.g. FT, FV, ....
rangeTimeResType = FT
# time steps used for creating diagram
distanceTimeSteps = 0:1
# threshold - below this result data is ignored - used to create mask
# average value created of where there is avalanche flow (threshold > 0.0)
# this is default set to 1.e-5 to account for any spurious values
# also a different threshold can be set e.g. if only regions with > 0.5m FT are of interest
thresholdResult = 1.e-5
# set minimum time step difference for computing approach velocity > 2s for discarding spurious effects
minVelTimeStep = 2.
