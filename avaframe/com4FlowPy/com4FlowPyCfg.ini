# Optional settings-------------------------------
[GENERAL]
#++++++++++++ Flow-Py Model Parameters
# alpha:
# Angle-of-reach Alpha [°] - defines max. longitudinal runout limit
# equivalent to a Coulomb-friction of tan(alpha) in a sliding block model
#---------------------
# exp:
# Spreading Coefficient (influences lateral spreading)
#---------------------
# flux_threshold:
# Flux threshold (influences lateral spreading)
#---------------------
# max_z:
# Energy-Line-Height Limit (can be interpreted as velocity limit)
# max_v = sqrt(max_z*19.62)
# typical values:
#   - Avalanche:   ~270 m ... ~72 m/s
#   - Rockfall:    ~130 m ... ~50 m/s
#   - Debris-flow:  ~12 m ... ~15 m/s
#---------------------

alpha = 25
exp = 8
flux_threshold = 3.0e-4
max_z = 8848

#++++++++++++ Use Infrastructure

infra = False

#++++++++++++ preview Mode
# if previewMode = True, not every release cell is processend independently
# if a releaseCell is already "hit"/"affected" by a prior calculated path
# then the processing of this release cell is skipped
# can be used for a faster preview of model results (e.g. for checking of input parameters) or
# to save calculation time (e.g. when calculating with infrastructure)
# NOTE: results will deviate from "normal" model run and all outputLayers relying on the
# summed/combined output of different paths will not provide sensible values!!!

previewMode = False


#++++++++++++ Use a dynamic u_max Limit
# Requires an additional tif-file containing the uMax  (in m/s)
# or zDeltaMax (m) Limits
# in every cell where a release cell is.
# the paths for each release cells are calculated with these uMax values
# (computed to z_delta, similar to the max_z) or zDelta values.
# In varUmaxParameter the parameter (uMax in m/s or zDeltaMax in m) 
# provided is given.
variableUmaxLim = False
varUmaxParameter = uMax

#++++++++++++ Use a dynamic alpha angle
# Requires an additional tif-file containing the alpha angles
# in every cell where a release cell is.
# The paths for each release cells are calculated with these alpha angles
variableAlpha = False

#++++++++++++ Use a dynamic exponent
# Requires an additional tif-file containing the exponents
# in every cell where a release cell is.
# The paths for each release cells are calculated with these exponent
variableExponent = False

#++++++++++++ Use Forest Information
# NOTE AH 20240408: Dummy settings for Forest Interaction
# The forest implementation should mimick/reproduce the
# one from the "foreste_detrainment" branch in the avaframe/FlowPy repo
# which is partly described in D'Amboise et al. (2021)
#
# Forest-Interaction is only used if 'forest' is set to 'True'
#++++++++++++
forest = False

#++++++++++++
# Type of Forest-Interaction Model to use (only works in conjunction with forest = True!)
# valid choices:
#
#     * 'forestFriction' (D'Amboise et al., 2021) - use added friction on forest Pixels
#            forest-Raster (set in 'forestPath') is assumed to have values between
#            0 (no Forest) and 1 (full protective function).
#        model behavior is governed by 'maxAddedFrictionFor', 'minAddedFrictionFor'
#        and 'velThForFriction'
#
#     * 'forestDetrainment' (D'Amboise et al., 2022?) - added friction and detrainment on forested Pixels
#            forest-Raster (set in 'forestPath') is assumed to have values between
#            0 (no Forest) and 1 (full protective function).
#        model behavior is governed by 'maxAddedFrictionFor', 'minAddedFrictionFor'
#        and 'velThForFriction', 'maxDetrainmentFor', 'minDetrainmentFor', 'velThForDetrain'
#
#     * 'forestFrictionLayer' - provide Layer with local alpha / local delta-Alpha on forested pixels / for all pixels in
#        the domain
#            forest-Raster (set in 'forestPath') is assumed to have values between 0° (no friction) and 90° (inf. friciton)
#        forest-Raster is either interpreted as 'absolute' or 'difference'
#            'absolute'   - absolute 'alpha' values are used on forested pixels (all pixels with values > 0)
#            'relative' - 'alpha' values are interpreted as additional friction on forested pixels (all pixels with
#                          values > 0)
#++++++++++++

# ['forestFriction', 'forestDetrainment', 'forestFrictionLayer']
forestModule = forestFriction
# ForestInteraction gives an additional output layer for the amount of forested cells
# a path ran through 
# (now implemented, only when forest = True) -> TODO: we dont require a forestModule to compute
# for ForestInteraction Layer, but we need to read in the Forest - Layer (requires forest = True)
forestInteraction = False

#++++++++++++ Forest added Friction
# These are the parameters for the "add friction on forested cells"-approach
# described in D'Amboise et al. (2021)
#
# maxAddedFrictionFor [°]: maximum increase of Alpha angle/basal friction on forested cells
# minAddedFrictionFor [°]: minimum increase of Alpha angle/basal friction on forested cells
# velThForFriction [m/s]: velocity threshold for forest-friction effect
#++++++++++++

maxAddedFrictionFor = 10
minAddedFrictionFor = 2
velThForFriction    = 30

#++++++++++++ Forest Detrainment
# These are the parameters for the "forestDetrainment"-approach - D'Amboise et al. (2022??)
# The idea is to remove 'virtual mass' (aka 'flux' in Flow-Py) from the modeled flow/process
# on forested pixels in dependency of FSI and local z_delta
#
# maxDetrainmentFor [°]: default set to '0' (i.e. no detrainment) - foreste_detrainment val:
# minDetrainmentFor [°]: default set to '0' (i.e. no detrainment) - foreste_detrainment val:
# velThForDetrain [m/s]: velocity threshold for forest-detraiment effect # default set to '0' (i.e. no detrainment) - foreste_detrainment val:
#++++++++++++

# velThForDetrain [m/s]: velocity threshold for forest-detraiment effect # default set to '0' (i.e. no detrainment) - foreste_detrainment val:
#++++++++++++

# ['absolute', 'relative']
forestFrictionLayerType = absolute

# skip Forest Effect (added forest friction) for first x meters (calculated in 3D - XYZ)
# should allow an initial acceleration phase of processes starting in or directly above
# dense forests (these would in many cases stop otherwise)
# if e.g. skipForestDist = 40, no added forestFriction will be assumed until 40 m 3D-distance
# along the path from the startCell.
skipForestDist = 0 

#++++++++++++ Method to calculate flux distribution
# We fixed a bug in flowClass.py, which affects the distribution of the remaining flux, 
# if a cell receives flux smaller than the provided flux_threshold. 
#
# The default now (post Jan. 2025) is a calculation with the fixed bug!
# 
# For backward compatibility the old version (prior to Jan. 2025 - with minor bug) can 
# be switched on by setting "fluxDistOldVersion = True".

fluxDistOldVersion = False

#++++++++++++ Parameters for Tiling
# tileSize: size of tiles in x and y direction in meters (if total size of) x
#           or y of input DEM is larger than tileSize, then the input raster
#           layers are tiles
# tileOverlap: overlap between single tiles in m (5 km is rather conservative)
#---------------------------------------

tileSize = 15000
tileOverlap = 5000

#++++++++++++ Parameters for CPU usage/multiprocessing
# Recommended to leave at default values unless performance has to be
# tweaked/optimized (e.g. for application on dedicated machines, maxing out
# computational resources)
#
# procPerCPUCore: number of processer per core for multiprocessing
#                default value = 1 (it is recommended not to change this value
#                unless you want to max. out CPUs, which might come at the cost
#                of RAM comsumption!!!)
# chunkSize: tbd.
# maxChunks: Maximum number of single tasks for multiprocessing, if set too high
#           this can max out RAM and lead to unexpected behavior (in this case
#           probably an infinite loop --> you see it in the .log if this happens)
#           On machines with a lot of CPUs and RAM this value might be set higher ...

# Optional Custom Paths
